In TA 3019 during the\nWar of the Ring, they aided the Dwarves in defending the Lonely Mountain\nfrom the Easterling Empire.\n\nIn addition to many of them being competent in Westron, they also spoke\ntheir own language, generally termed “Dalish” and resembling the North\nGermanic languages.\n\n\nNames\n\nThe Men of Dale are named after their home city of DALE, which is\nderived from the English word meaning “valley”, in turn derived from\nProto-Germanic _*dalan_, with cognates in Old Norse (_dalr_), Gothic and\nDutch (_dal_), and German (_Thal_). Another common name for them\ntowards the end of the Third Age was BARDINGS, meaning “followers of\nBard”, _-ing_ being a patrynomic suffix and Bard meaning Bard the\nBowman, the first restored king of Dale and the slayer of Smaug.\n",

For this insult it is said the Dwarves slew him.\n\n\nThe Seat of Durin's Realm\n\nIn TA 2210 King Thorin I, learning that most of his people were\ngathering in the Grey Mountains, left the Lonely Mountain to join the\nDwarves to the north, for those mountains were rich and little explored.\n\n\nThe War of the Dwarves and Dragons\n\nFor many years Durin's folk prospered in the Ered Mithrin, but the\nDragons in the wastes beyond began to multiply again and made war on the\nDwarves in TA 2570, and plundered their works.\n\nAfter 19 years the War of the Dwarves and Dragons came to an end when a\ngreat Cold-drake killed King Dáin I, and his second son Frór at the door\nof his hall. A year later most of Durin's folk abandoned the Grey\nMountains. Grór, youngest son of the king went with many followers to\nthe Iron Hills. In the mean time, the new King Thrór along with his\nuncle Borin, and the remainder of the people went back to Erebor.\n\n\nRemaining Peoples, and Later History\n\nThere still was a remnant of the Dwarves in the Ered Mithrin after the\ncore of the population left but were probably few. Working whatever\nmines they could hold from the Orcs and Dragons, but is speculated that\nthey may have left at some point as well.\n\nIt is likely that the Dwarves reclaimed all their old halls and mines\nsometime during the Fourth Age, if not after Dain II Ironfoot became\nking of Durin's folk in the late Third Age."

    "text": "The PETTY-DWARVES (named in Sindarin NOEGYTH NIBIN or NIBIN-NOEG, part\nof an older and longer word BAR-EN-NIBIN-NOEG) were a diminutive race of\ndwarves that lived in the Beleriand in Middle-earth during the First\nAge. They differed from normal dwarves in various ways: they were\nsmaller, far more unsociable, and they freely gave away their names;\nother dwarves kept their Khuzdul names and language a secret.\n\n\nHistory\n\n The Petty-dwarves were dwarves of\nseveral houses, which had been exiled for reasons unknown in very\nancient times during the Peace of Arda. They were the first to cross the\nBlue Mountains (Ered Luin) in the First Age, and established strongholds\nin Beleriand before the building of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue\nMountains, and before the elves arrived. They delved the very ancient\nsettlements of Nulukkizdin (Nargothrond) and Amon Rûdh but they dwindled\nbefore the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth.\n\nThe Sindar, not yet acquainted with dwarves, thought the Petty-dwarves\nwere animals, and hunted them. Not until the dwarves of the Ered Luin\nestablished contact with the Sindar did the latter realize what the\nPetty-dwarves were. Afterwards they were mostly left alone, but not\nbefore the Petty-dwarves came to hate all elves with a passion.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Jewels, after the Return of the Ñoldor,\nthe Petty-dwarves had nearly died out. By the fifth Century of the First\nAge, the last remnant of their people were Mîm and his two sons, who\nlived at Amon Rûdh. Túrin and his men shot at the dwarves, mistaking\nthem for animals or orcs. Mim survived, but an arrow had killed one of\nhis sons, Khîm. Mim's other son had been killed by orcs, leaving Mim the\nlast of his kind. Mîm was killed by Húrin after the latter's release\nfrom Angband, and the Petty-dwarves were no more.\n\n\nOrigin in Tolkien's writings\n\nThe Petty-dwarves were created from remnant ideas based on the Nauglath\nin Tolkien's earliest writings in the _The Book of Lost Tales_. They\nwere more or less created to explain the difference between the dwarves\nlater writings such as The Hobbit in comparison to the wicked dwarves\nfrom his earlier stories which he hadn't yet completely abandoned.\nHowever, some of the ideas of the Nauglath were reincorporated into the\nNaugrim (Dwarves) by J.R.R. Tolkien or his son in the published\nSilmarillion and separate from the Petty-dwarves (such as the history of\nBelegost and Nogrod, and the Sack of Doriath events).\n\n''_'Niwennog_ '''was their first ascribed name (preceding the change to\n_Nibin-noeg_), as told of in the index of _The War of the Jewels.",

All the Minyar and most of the Tatyar and\nNelyar were persuaded and followed Oromë into the west on the Great\nJourney. The remainder of the Tatyar and Nelyar remained suspicious of\nthe Lords of the west, seeing them only in their wrath, or they simply\nrefused to depart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout\nthe wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after known in Quenya, the\nlanguage of the Eldar that eventually reached Valinor, by the name\n_Avari_, meaning “the Unwilling”, because they refused the summons.\n\nHaving never come to Valinor, the Avari remained wild folk, dwellers of\nforests. Little is known of them, as they do not appear in any of the\ntales, save some references to Avari creeping in the south of Beleriand\nin the First Age. Some of them merged with the Nandor and Sindar in\nEriador and the Vale of Anduin. Also, it is speculated that the Dark\nElves were the first other sentient race encountered by the race of Men\nduring their infancy. The Dark Elves probably taught them many of the\nbasic crafts of civilization, though the craft of the Eldar surpassed\nthat of the Avari even more than that of the Avari surpassed primitive\nMen.\n\nIn _The War of the Jewels_, names of six tribes of Avari in their own\nlanguages are given, all being cognates of the Quenya word Quendi (_the\nSpeakers_): KINDI, CUIND, HWENTI, WINDAN, KINN-LAI, PENNI. They are the\nonly certain Avarin words ever mentioned in the published Middle-earth\nmaterial. It is speculated however that Dorwinion was an Avarin land,\nwith WINION carrying the meaning of “Wine”.\n\nThe Silmarillion contains a suggestion that orcs may be descended from\nAvarin elves captured and corrupted by Melkor.\n\nEöl was called the 'Dark Elf' for he shuns the daylight, preferring to\nstay within the dark woods of Nan Elmoth and walk under the moon and\nstarlights but he is not of Avari origin for he is a kin of Thingol. His\nroots lies with the Teleri, who did not go to Aman, later called the\nSindarin under the rule of Thingol and Melian the Maia.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn older versions of the legendarium, the name _Avari_ was originally\nthat of the later Eldar, then meaning “those that departed”.\n\nIn other, relatively late writings, a brief idea was that the Avari did\nnot come from the three clans, but from two other clans, led by Nurwë\nand Morwë. This idea was later dropped. In the final conception, the\nelves were divided into three tribes.",

    "text": "URUK-HAI (or simply URUKS) were the strongest species of Orc in\nMiddle-earth, who at separate instances originated from Mordor and\nIsengard in the Third Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Uruks first appeared about the year TA 2475, in which they came and\nconquered Ithilien in Gondor, and destroyed the city of Osgiliath. The\nUruks in the service of Barad-dûr used the symbol of the red Eye of\nSauron. The Red Eye was also painted on their shields.\n\nUruk-hai were later bred by Saruman late in the Third Age, by his dark\narts in the pits of Isengard. In the War of the Ring, the Uruk-hai made\nup a large part of Saruman's army, together with the Dunlendings,\nman-enemies of Rohan. There are suggestions that the Uruk-hai were the\nresult of crossbreeding orcs and men. There were other creatures in\nSaruman's armies, and under his command in the Shire, that appear to\nhave been hybrids. “Half-orcs” were as tall as Men and are never\ndescribed simply as orcs, as the Uruk-hai frequently are. Saruman's army\nof Uruk-hai fought against King Théoden of Rohan and his people at the\nHelm's Deep.\n\n\n\nThe Uruks of Saruman the White used an Elf-rune wrought in white metal\non the front of their iron helms. It was clear this stood for Saruman,\nbecause their shields had a small white hand (the symbol of Saruman)\ncentered on a black field. Aragorn commented that their gear was not in\nthe manner of other orcs at all. Instead of the curved scimitar, they\nused short, broad-bladed swords. Their great bows were made of yew wood,\nof the same length and shape as those of men.\n\nSaruman appeared to aid his orcs with his wizardry as well: when\nAragorn, Gimli, and Legolas followed the party of Uruks who kidnapped\nMerry and Pippin, Saruman's will caused weariness of the heart for the\npursuers and lent speed to the orcs. This was the group that slew\nBoromir, and was later annihilated by Éomer and the Riders of\nRohan.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Uruk-hai_ was a Black Speech word that meant “Orc-folk”. The name\n“Uruk-hai” has the element _Uruk_, a Black Speech word related to “orc”\nand to the (Valinórean) Quenya word _urko_ (Ñoldorin Quenya: _orko_) of\nthe same meaning. The element hai means “folk”, so “Uruk-hai” is\n“Orc-folk”. A similar term is Olog-hai (“troll-folk”), used for a breed\nof especially strong and vicious trolls capable of surviving sunlight.\n\nChristopher Tolkien describes “uruks” as an Anglicization of “Uruk-hai”,\nand his father used the two terms interchangeably a number of times.\nSome readers assume the two terms are different because in The Lord of\nthe Rings 'Uruk-hai' is used primarily to describe Saruman's forces\nwhile 'uruks' and 'Black Uruks of Mordor' are used primarily to describe\nSauron's. However, there are examples of each term being used in\nreference to either group. While 'Uruk-hai' means simply 'Orc-folk', the\nterm was reserved for the soldier orcs of Mordor and Isengard, with\nsnaga ('slave') being their term for other breeds.",

Beren was\nnow the last person of the house of Bëor but in the Second Age some\nfamilies of Númenor still spoke Adûnaic with a notable Bëorian accent.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of faithful were those of Bëorian descent.\nThis was because the majority of the Men of Bëor had settled in the\nwestern part of Numenor, which later became the area controlled by the\nfaithful Lords of Andúnië. Traits of the House of Bëor were passed down\nto the Dúnedain of the Middle-earth and can be seen in Aragorn II\nElessar's physical description: lean, dark and tall, with “a shaggy head\nof dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen\ngrey eyes.”\n\n\nNotable members\n\n-   BËOR THE OLD, originally named Balan and later given the title _the\n    Old_, was leader of the House of Bëor, the first men to travel into\n    Beleriand. He met Finrod Felagund, who guided them to settle in\n    Estolad, east of Doriath. Bëor took service with Finrod in\n    Nargothrond. His name _Bëor_ meant _vassal_ in the Bëorian tongue.\n    He got his title, _the Old_, because he died at 93 years of age, of\n    which 44 were spent serving Finrod.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAN was the eldest son of Bëor the Old and took up the leadership\n    of the House of Bëor when his father departed to Nargothrond. He\n    dwelt in Estolad and had two sons, BORON and BARANOR.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREG, a grandson of Baran, was dissatisfied with Estolad, and led\n    part of the people away to parts unknown, disappearing from the\n    histories. It is possible some of his descendants were the ancestors\n    of the later Men of Eriador.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BOROMIR was a son of Boron. The later Boromir of Gondor was named\n    after him. Boromir was granted the land of Ladros in Dorthonion as a\n    fief, and his house removed there.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOR was a son of Boromir and Andreth was Boromir's daughter.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOLAS, who died in the Dagor Bragollach, and BARAHIR were sons of\n    Bregor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREN was a son of Barahir, perhaps the greatest hero of the First\n    Age. He and Luthíen went to Morgoth and successfully cut a Silmaril\n    from his crown.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAGUND was a son of Bregolas and a direct descendant of Bëor the\n    Old.

Their first independent King was Meneldil, the nephew\nof Isildur, whose line ruled over Gondor for more than two thousand\nyears. Unlike their cousins in the North, the Dúnedain of the South\nmaintained their realm even after the loss of its Kings, and it survived\nunder the rule of the Stewards until the time of the War of the Ring,\nwhen the Kingship was restored.\n\n\nDescription and Historical accounts\n\nBeing mostly of Númenórean stock and ruled by exiled Númenórean\noverlords, the Men of Gondor continued most of the customs and\ntraditions of Númenór. However, over the centuries, they mixed more and\nmore with the men of Middle-earth. One of these peoples was the Northmen\nwho lived in Rhovanion, and Gondor, ever needing allies, began\nacquainting themselves with these men by the mid Third Age. Brave and\nvaliant, but by the standards of the Dúnedain shorter lived, the\nNorthmen gradually had more and more to do with Gondor, and one of its\nheirs to the throne, Valacar, who lived and worked with them in their\nown land as an ambassador, married one of their noble ladies, setting\nthe stages for the Kin-strife. \n\nOver the next few hundred years afterward, war, rebellion, and plague\nseverally weakened the blood of the Dúnedain in Gondor. Their rulers\nthough survived and retained many of the ancient customs. As the\ncenturies rolled on into the late Third Age, the Men of Gondor\naccustomed to war and invasion became a hardy and stern people more\nlikened to Middle-earth. They became summed up in the phrase, “when\nheads are at a loss, bodies must serve.”\n\nBy the time of just before War of the Ring, the Men of Gondor grappled\nconstantly with the forces of Mordor giving and regaining ground to the\nDark Lord's armies. Their leader Denethor II could foresee nothing but a\nvictory in single combat on the battlefield against him or total doom,\nso when it became clear that Sauron's lost Ring of Power had been found,\nhe and people like his son and others wanted the Ring to be taken by\nGondor and be used against the enemy as a weapon. The Men of Gondor were\nspared the folly of this choice when Denethor's youngest son Faramir let\nFrodo and Sam continue to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.\n\nAfter the war was won and Aragorn II Elessar was crowned, the Men of\nGondor were rekindled with the ancient tradition of the Dúnedain of old\nwhen Elendil founded the Two Kingdoms with his two sons: Isildur and\nAnárion. They thrived and prospered as part of the Reunited Kingdom into\nFourth Age and beyond.\n\n\nNotable Men of Gondor\n\nImage:Seanbean boromir.jpg|Boromir Image:Faramir3.jpg|Faramir\nImage:Denethor.jpg|Denethor II",

Those who came to Aman became known as the Falmari. They\nwere the ancestors of the Valinorean Teleri, and the Sindar, Laiquendi,\nand Nandor of Middle-earth.\n\nThe third clan was the largest of the three houses of the Elves, and\nmost of the Avari originally belonged to them. In ancient times they\nnamed themselves LINDAR (Q. IPA: ; singular _LINDA_; adjectival\n_LINDARIN_; ), or “Singers”, because they were known for their fair\nvoices. They were also called NELYAR (Q. IPA: ; “The Third”; singular\nNELYA; adjectival NELYARIN; ). The Sindar of Beleriand called themselves\nsimply _Edhil_, which means _Elves_, and is related to the Quenya word\n_Eldar_ of the same meaning. According to legend, the Teleri were\ndescended from Enel, the third Elf to awake in Cuivienen, his spouse\nEnelyë and their 72 companions, but it was Olwë , the younger brother of\nthe Telerin emissary, Elwë, who eventually became their king.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Teleri were sundered from the first two clans, the Vanyar and the\nÑoldor, because they tarried behind searching for their lost king Elwë\n(later known as Thingol), and the first two clans were ferried across to\nValinor on a huge island before. The Maia Ossë kept them company while\nthey waited, and became their friend. Later when Ulmo returned with the\nisland ferry, the Teleri had grown to love the sea. Ossë convinced Ulmo\nto anchor the island in the bay of Eldamar, off the shores of Aman, and\npersuaded many of the Teleri to remain in Middle-Earth. The Teleri long\nremained on Tol Eressëa, and their language changed in different ways\nfrom that of the Vanyar and Ñoldor. Much later the Teleri learned to\nbuild ships, and finally made it to Aman.\n\nThe Teleri refused to join the Ñoldor in leaving Valinor, and many of\nthem were cruelly slain in the Kinslaying at their chief city of\nAlqualondë, or Swan Harbour. For this reason few or none of the Teleri\njoined the host of the Valar which set out to capture Morgoth for good.\nIt is recounted that the Teleri eventually forgave the Ñoldor for the\nKinslaying, and the two kindreds were at peace again.\n\nTheir tongue, known as _Telerin_ or _Lindalambë_ (tongue of the Lindar),\nwas considered by some to be a dialect of Quenya, but the Teleri\nthemselves considered it to be an independent language. It was much more\nconservative than Quenya, and was the closest to Common Telerin (from\nwhich Sindarin and Nandorin were also derived), and even to Common\nEldarin of the later Elvish languages.\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the early versions of Tolkien's mythology (see: _The History of\nMiddle-earth_), they were known as '' SOLOSIMPI'' (“Pipers of the\nShores”), while the name _Teleri_ was given to the clan of Elves known\nin the published version of _The Silmarillion_ as Vanyar. _'_Nelyar\n_'_and _LINDAR,_ the earlier versions of the term _“Teleri”_, were used\nin the writings that are compiled in _The War of the Jewels_.",

They were counted amongst the Edain.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Drúedain developed a close relationship with the Folk of Haleth, the\nEdain that inhabited that forest region. The Drúedain lived among the\nSecond House of Men, the Haladin, in the First Age in the forest of\nBrethil. There were also a number of the Drúedain present in Numenor,\nthough they had left or died out before the Akallabêth, as had the\nPúkel-men of Dunharrow. At the end of the Third Age, the Drûg still\nlived in the Drúadan Forest of the White Mountains, and on the long cape\nof Andrast west of Gondor. The region north of Andrast was still known\nas Drúwaith Iaur, or “Old Drûg land”.\n\nThe Woses of Ghân-buri-Ghân held off Orcs with poisoned arrows and were\nvital in securing the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields. After the War of the Ring, King Aragorn II Elessar granted the\nDrúadan Forest “forever” to them in the Fourth Age, promising that no\nman would enter their forests without the leave of the Drúedain.\n\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\n\n\nThey were an alien folk to the other Men: a bit like Dwarves in stature\nand endurance, stumpy, clumsy-limbed (with short, thick legs, and fat,\n“gnarled” arms), had broad chests, fat bellies, and heavy buttocks.\nAccording to the Elves and other Men, they had “unlovely faces”: wide,\nflat, and expressionless with deep-set black eyes that glowed red when\nangered. They had “horny” brows, flat noses, wide mouths, and sparse,\nlanky hair. They had no hair lower than the eyebrows, except for a few\nmen who had a tail of black hair on the chin. They were short lived and\nhad a deep hatred of Orcs. Their characteristics may have originated in\nthe First Age. People who didn't know them very well may have thought\nthat Morgoth may have captured some men as they did with the elves and\nbred Orcs from their stock leading to the conclusion that the Drúedain\ncould have possibly been Men that escaped, but were more deformed but\nnot very Orc-like.

These\nelves passed westward into the Beleriand over the Blue Mountains and\ncame to reside in Ossiriand, the _Land of Seven Rivers,_ and were quite\nsecretive there.\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Laiquendi had vast knowledge of nature and preferred living in\nforests besides waterfalls and streams, probably living off of simple\nhunting and gathering. They made no weapons of steel, had only bows and\narrows - which they were experts at handling.

Their culture remained unique and distinct for many\nhundreds of years as they were for the most part a simple, peaceful, and\nreclusive people.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Laiquendi can be traced to the Telerin Elves of the host of Olwë,\nwho coming upon the Great River Anduin and seeing the seemingly\nimpassable peaks of the Misty Mountains, forsook the westward journey\nand became a separated people. These Elves followed Lenwë down the banks\nof the Anduin and once again became separated. The fate of many of these\nelves is uncertain; what is certain though is that some wandered into\nEriador making contact with the Dwarves, probably learning from them\nabout the great Sindarin King Thingol ruling peaceful territories in the\nrich lands of the Beleriand, prompting them to cross the Blue Mountains.\nFollowing their King Denethor, they made permanent settlement in the\nOssiriand, which was after named Lindon, or _Land of the singers_ after\nthese elves. They quickly made friends with Thingol, who recognized them\nas long lost kin of old.\n\nMorgoth, returning to Middle-earth with the Silmarils before his\npursuers the Ñoldor, quickly occupied his strongholds of old in the far\nnorth and resumed his plans for conquest. He invaded the Beleriand.\nSeeking aid, Thingol called on the Laiquendi and Denethor answered\nleading an army against their enemy’s eastern host, but were driven off\nand surrounded at Amon Ereb before they could be rescued by Thingol's\narmy. Their simplistic weapons were little to no match for the servants\nand beasts of Morgoth, thus they suffered heavy losses and Denethor was\nslain. Afterwards they became a secretive people never again naming a\nlord or a king and played no further part in the Battles of the\nBeleriand again, until the latter days of Beren and Lúthien.\n\nWhen Menhad begun migrating west looking for new lands, the Laiquendi\nfeared them greatly and hid themselves away threatening to attack them\nif Finrod didn’t lead them away from the Ossiriand. They are not\nmentioned again in the First Age until the later days of Beren and\nLúthien who lived in their lands on Tol Galen between the river Adurant.\nThey had a great respect for them and their friendship with Beren led\nthem to take up arms for one last time when they helped him and his son\nambush the Dwarves who sacked Menegroth. After the destruction of the\nBeleriand, the surviving Laiquendi merged with the Elves of Lindon and\nthe peoples of the Elven realms of Lothlórien and Mirkwood over the next\nfew ages.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_LAIQUENDI_ is a Quenyan word that meant “Green-elves”. The Sindarin\nform was LAEGRIM.",

    "text": "The STOORS are one of the three races of Hobbits, they mostly inhabited\nswampy areas.\n\nIn their earliest recorded history the Stoors, like the other Hobbits,\nlived in the Vales of Anduin. They were a riverside people that dwelt in\nthe Gladden Fields, and were fishermen.\n\nOne of the most infamous Stoors was Smeagol, who would later become a\ncreature known as the Gollum.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThey were heavier and broader in build than the other Hobbits, and had\nlarge hands and feet. Among the Hobbits, the Stoors most resembled Men\nand were most friendly to them. Stoors were the only Hobbits who\nnormally grew facial hair.\n\nA habit which set them apart from the Harfoots who lived in the mountain\nfoothills, and the Fallohides who lived in forests far to the north, was\nthat Stoors preferred flat lands and riversides. Only Stoors used boats,\nfished, and could swim. They also wore boots in muddy weather.\n\nStoorish characteristics and appearances remained amongst the Hobbits of\nthe Eastfarthing, Buckland (such as the Brandybucks) and the\nBree-hobbits\n\nThe Stoors also had their own dialect of Hobbitish, owing to the fact\nthat they spent some time in Dunland and adopted many strange words and\nnames which they took to the Shire, and retained even until the late\nThird Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Stoors are believed to live in the southern vales of Anduin. During\nthe Hobbit Wandering Days, after the Harfoots had migrated westward in\nThird Age 1050, and the Fallohides followed them about a century later,\nthe Stoors long remained back in the vale of Anduin, but between T.A.\n1150 and 1300 they, too migrated west.\n\nUnlike the other Hobbit-kinds they took the Redhorn Pass and followed a\nsouthern route, where many Stoors branched off and moved south to the\nAngle of Eriador, south of Rivendell and mingled with the Harfoots and\nFallohides that lived there; but most went to Dunland (Swanfleet near\nTharbad) which most resembled their old lands. There they came into\ncontact with the Dunlendings. This contact altered their speech\nslightly, mostly by picking up a few Dunlending words.\n\nA hundred years later Angmar began to threaten Eriador and many Stoors\nof the Angle fled south to their kin in Dunland where they became a\nwoodland people; others returned to Rhovanion and settled the Gladden\nFields, becoming riverland people Déagol and Sméagol belonged to (c.\nT.A. 2430). There they had a matriarchal society. What became of\nthose Stoors and whether they rejoined their folk in Eriador, no history\ntells.\n\nThe Stoors of Dunland moved back north to join the other Hobbits in\ncolonizing the Shire about T.A. 1630 and settled mostly in the\nEastfarthing and Southfarthing. The result was that places that were\nsettled by Stoors have some slight linguistic oddities due to their time\nof separation and contact with the Dunlendings. The three original\nHobbit-kinds merged and blended in the centuries since the settlement of\nthe Shire, but regional variations remained.\n\nSome of these villages might have survived until the War of the Ring,\nwhen they were sought out by the Ringwraiths.\n\nHowever, most Stoors fled to the north and west, ending up in the newly\nfounded Shire around 1630. There they mingled with the Harfoots and\nFallohides, becoming the Shire-folk however they predominantly stayed in\nEastfarthing and then migrated to Buckland.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nStoor is supposed to be a special Hobbitish word that did not exist in\nWestron during the War of the Ring.\n\nEarly English stor, stoor means “large, strong”, referring to the fact\nthat these Hobbits were of heavier build",

His son, Thorin I, later became King under\nthe Mountain but after seeing the wealth of the Dwarves of the Grey\nMountains, he abandoned Erebor.\n\nWhen the Cold-drakes invaded the Grey Mountains, they drove most of the\nDwarves out. Thrór, a descendant of Thorin I, took some of his people\nand flew the Grey Mountains for Erebor. His brother Grór continued east\nwith a great following of Durin's folk to the Iron Hills while himself\nrefounded the kingdom of Erebor in TA 2590.\n\nSecond Kingdom\n\nThe Dwarves gained the friendship of the Northmen along the Celduin and\nhad much trade of goods, beautiful trinkets, and weapons with the town\nof Dale. The Dwarves of Erebor also had much traffic of ores with their\nkinsmen in the Iron Hills and the region had peace and prosperity for\nmany years.\n\nThe Dwarves were properous, and made great wealth for themselves until\nthey were dispossessed of their immense wealth by Smaug the Dragon, who\nflew south from the Ered Mithrin and sacked their kingdom in TA 2770.\n\nThe Dwarves reclaimed their inheritance many years later under the\nleadership of Thorin II. But it was the descendants of Dain II Ironfoot\nthat ruled there ever after.\n\nThird Kingdom\n\nAfter the restoration thanks to Thorin and Company, the Dwarves became\nagain rich and prosperous under Dáin's rule, as the Dwarves exceeded\ntheir ancestors in masonry and mining. Dale was rebuilt as a kingdom and\nthey had a close friendship with the Elves of Mirkwood.\n\nBalin and other Dwarves set out to reclaim Moria in TA 2989. Dáin did\nnot give his blessing when Balin, but could not dissuade them. It was\nonly later learned the colony was destroyed after five years.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nIn TA 3018, a messenger came from Mordor, enquiring about “Baggins” from\n“Shire”, promising the last three Dwarf-rings to Dáin. The King asked\ntime to think and he sent Glóin and his son Gimli to Elrond for council,\nand to warn Bilbo.\n\nThe War of the Ring reached the North; King Brand fighting the\nEasterlings retreated from the River Carnen and was given aid by Dwarves\nin the Battle of Dale. After three days of fighting Dwarves and Men were\ndriven back, and Brand was slain, followed by Dáin. Several days\nlater the Easterlings learned that the War was lost. When the new King\nThorin III Stonehelm, son of Dáin, and Brand's Bard II saw this they\ncame out of the mountain and routed their enemies.\n\nLittle is known of the reign of Thorin III, other than the Dwarves\nhelped rebuild the cities of Minas Tirith and the fortress of Helm's\nDeep. Some of the Dwarves colonized the Glittering Caves.\n\n\nLanguage and writing\n\nThe Dwarves of Erebor spoke Khuzdul but used the Language of Dale for\ntheir public names.\n\nComing from Moria, the Dwarves brought with them the Angerthas Moria,\nwhich however was modified further. For some reason some runes of\nAngerthas Moria were reverted back to their Elvish values in Angerthas.\nThe resulting variation was known as Angerthas Erebor.\n\n\nMembers\n\nNoted Dwarves from Erebor were:\n\n-   THRÁIN I\n-   THORIN I\n-   THRÓR\n-   Thráin II\n-   Thorin\n-   Balin, Dwalin\n-   Dori, Nori, Ori\n-   Óin, Glóin\n-   Bifur, Bofur, Bombur\n-   Kíli and Fíli\n-   Gimli\n-   Dain II Ironfoot\n-   Thorin III Stonehelm\n-   Floi, Loni, Nali, Frár\n-   Dís\n-   Frerin\n-   Fundin\n",

    "text": "The DÚNEDAIN (singular: _Dúnadan_) were Men descended from the\nNúmenóreans who survived the fall of their island kingdom, Numenor, and\nmigrated to Eriador in Middle-earth, led at first by Elendil and his\nsons. They were known as the “MEN OF THE WEST” and the “Men of\nWesternesse” (direct translations of the Sindarin term). They settled\nmainly in Arnor and Gondor, but during the Third Age only in the\nGondor-region.\n\nHistory\n\nThe term _DÚNEDAIN_ designated the “Edain of the West”, the Númenóreans,\nalthough the term came out of use amongst the King´s Men and came to\ndenote especially the descendants of the Elendili, the Númenórean\nColonists in Arnor and Gondor or Dúnedain of the North and Dúnedain of\nthe South. The Noble Families of high-blood continued to consider\nthemselves Dúnedain while they denominated the mixed-blooded common\npeople as “lesser Dúnedain” or _Tergil_ (_Haeranedain_ in Rhudaur).\n\nAfter the fall of Arnor and then Arthedain, some of the northern\nDúnedain became the Rangers of the North in Evendim. The surviving\nDúnedain population of Arnor retreated to the Angle south of Rivendell.\nIn the meantime the southern Dúnedain intermarried more and more with\nso-called Middle Men, except in some regions (such as Dol Amroth).\n\nDuring and even before the War of the Ring, Dúnedain Rangers went\nthrough a variety of different duties. Some were stationed around the\nShire, protecting it from the forces of darkness. Others simply\npatrolled the northern lands, hunting and defeating any enemies they\nfound. In general, Dúnedain Rangers mainly took care of themselves and\nof lands of the Free Peoples, though if they were called upon to battle\n(by Gondor or some other land in need) they were quite willing to do so.\n\nRangers used a variety of weapons to achieve victory in battles.\nNon-canonical information hints that they preferred bows and archery as\ntheir primary weapons, though this is not always the case (Aragorn, for\nexample, used a sword). They also used swords to engage in close combat\nif necessary. The Dúnedain mainly rely on stealth as an advantage rather\nthan an actual face-to-face confrontation. It is also hinted that their\nbattle skill was greater than that of a standard Gondor soldier or\narcher.\n\nIn the Fourth Age, the Dunedain of Gondor and Arnor were reunited under\nking Aragorn II Elessar (who was also called _the Dúnadan_).\n\nCharacteristics\n\nDirect descendants of the Dúnedain are known to have lived longer than\nnormal Men. A good example is Aragorn who, in the movies, tells Éowyn he\nis 87 years old, although he appears to be relatively young. It is said\nthat Dúnedain live three times longer than normal men. That would\ntranslate that the Dúnedain's average lifespan is up 140 to 250 years,\ngiven normal human lifespan. It is possible with the blood of the\nDúnedain renewed by Aragorn and Arwen's marriage that some generations\nthereafter would experience lifetimes similar to that of the generations\nfollowing Elros - between 400 and 500 years of life - however, Aragorn\ndid have the longest uninterrupted reign of all his descendants.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Westron name for _Dúnadan_ was simply _Adûn_, “westerner”, but this\nname was seldom used. This name was reserved to those Númenóreans who\nwere friendly to the Elves:\n\nTERGIL (Sgl.“Targil” Q.“Tarkil”) or TORFIRIATH were the descendants of\nDúnedain who had intermarried with other peoples (usually middle-men).\nThey were also known as _Lesser Dúnedain_. Most Men of Gondor and of\nEriador were of this race.\n\nKnown Dúnedain\n\n- Argeleb I - Arathorn I - Aragorn I - Arador - Araglas - Arahad I -\nAragost - Eradan - Aragorn II - Halbarad",

    "text": "The '''Barrow-wights '''were shape-shifting beings of darkness, similar\nin circumstance to Wraiths, who dwelt in dark places of Eriador such as\nthe Barrow-downs.\n\nThe characteristic of shape-shifter gave Barrow-wights the ability to\nreanimate whatever life-form they wished. The ones which attacked the\nfour Hobbits reanimated the corpses of the Kings of the Barrows. Most\noften the Barrow-wight came on the unwary traveller in the guise of a\ndark phantom whose eyes were luminous and cold. The voice of the figure\nwas at once horrible and hypnotic; its skeletal hand had a touch like\nice and a grip like the iron jaws of a trap. Once under the spell, the\nvictim had no will of his own. In this way the Barrow-wights drew the\nliving into the tombs of the downs. A dismal choir of tortured souls\ncould be heard inside the Barrow as, in the green half-light, the\nBarrow-wight laid his victim on a stone altar and bound him in chains of\ngold. He draped him in pale cloth and precious jewelry of the ancient\ndead, and with a sacrificial sword ended them.\n\n\n\nEast of the Brandywine River beyond the Old Forest were the\nBarrow-downs, the most ancient burial ground of men in Middle-earth.\nThere were no trees nor water there, but only grass and turf covering\ndome-shaped hills that were crowned with monoliths and great rings of\nbone-white stone. These hills were the burial mounds that were made in\nthe First Age of the Sun for the Kings of Men. For many ages the\nBarrow-downs were sacred and revered, until out of the Kingdom of Angmar\nmany terrible and tortured spirits fled across Middle-earth, desperately\nsearching to hide from the ravening light of the Sun. Demons whose\nbodies had been destroyed looked for other bodies in which their evil\nspirits could dwell. And so it was that the Barrow-downs became a\nhaunted and terrible place. The demons became Barrow-wights, the Undead\nwho animated the bones and jeweled armor of the ancient Kings of Men who\nhad lived in the First Age of the Sun.\n\n\n\nIn the darkness they were powerful spirits and they could be held at bay\nonly with the spell of strong incantations, such as Tom Bombadil's song.\nHowever, normally they could be destroyed only by exposure to light, the\nentity they hated and feared the most. The Barrow-wights were lost and\ntortured spirits, and their last chance to remain upon Earth depended on\nthe dark security of burial vaults. Once the stone chamber was broken\nopen, light would pour in on the Barrow-wights and they would fade like\nmist before the sun and be gone forever.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Barrow-wights began appearing in the Barrow-downs after the Dúnedain\nof Cardolan succumbed to the ravages of the Great Plague. They were put\nthere by sorcerers of Angmar who corrupted the souls of the inhabitants\nof the Barrow-downs. The sorcerers were sent by the Witch-king of Angmar\nwho wished to keep the Dúnedain away from there.\n\nOn September 28 of 3018 Frodo Baggins and his companions, Sam Gamgee,\nMerry, and Pippin while passing through the Barrow-downs were captured\none by one by the Barrow-wights, and trapped in what was believed to be\nthe cairn of the last prince of Cardolan.\n\nThere they were almost slain by a wight; three of the Hobbits had been\nlain in a barrow filled with a strange green light and were dressed in\nwhite robes and wore jewels and gold and had a sword across their necks.\nThe wight had finished an incantation, and was preparing to finish them\noff when Frodo summoned up the courage to slice off its hand; he then\ncalled upon Tom Bombadil when the wight extinguished the dim light in\nthe cavern. Bombadil performed some kind of exorcism on the barrow,\nthrough the rare power of his singing, which caused the wight to flee\nwith a shriek; he then gave the hobbits swords and then spread out the\ngold and treasures from the barrow on the grass, so that the barrow's\nspell was broken and no Wight could make habitat there.\n\n\n"

    "lotr_page_id": "2352",
    "text": "The AINUR, also known as the HOLY ONES, are beings encompassing both the\nValar and the Maiar. They were the first and mightiest beings created by\nEru Ilúvatar in the depths of time before the beginning of the World.\n\nThey were primordial spirits who existed with Ilúvatar, and with him\ncreated the world through the '''Ainulindalë, '''the MUSIC OF THE AINUR.\nAfter the creation of Arda, many of the Ainur descended into it to guide\nand order its growth; of these there were fifteen more powerful than the\nrest. Fourteen of these great Ainur became known as the Valar, or Powers\nof Arda. The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that path and became\nthe first Dark Lord. The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar\ninto Arda are known as Maiar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Ainur were the 'offspring of Ilúvatar's thought' and each was given\nunderstanding only of that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he or\nshe came. The exception to this was Melkor, a brother in spirit to\nManwë, who later became The Lord of the Valar and he was given some of\nthe parts from which the others had come, but for all his gifts he did\nnot know the full mind of Eru. Melkor and Manwë were the most powerful\nof the Ainur.\n\nThe Ainur were 'kindled with the Flame Imperishable', which can be taken\nto mean that they were granted free will by their Creator. Ilúvatar\ninstructed them in the arts of music, until he brought them together to\nmake the Music of the Ainur: the great song that created the Vision of\nIlúvatar and ultimately the real world. In the beginning of the Music,\nthe Ainur were all in harmony with Eru and one another, but Melkor\nturned instead to his own pride, seeking power for himself and bringing\ndiscord to the Great Music. He later led many of the Maiar astray as\nwell.\n\n\nThe Ainur and the World\n\nThrough the Music of the Ainur, Ilúvatar created a Vision of the World;\nhe showed it to the Ainur, and explained much of its nature and destiny\nto them - the Ainur therefore have much knowledge of the World, but are\nnot themselves omniscient. Ilúvatar then granted the World true being by\ndeclaring “Eä”, causing these visions to come into being. Melkor and\nmany of the other mighty Ainur desired to descend into it and form it in\nreadiness for the coming of the Children of Ilúvatar (that is, Elves and\nMen).  Upon descending into the World, the Ainur became known as the\nValar and the Maiar.\n\nThose Ainur who entered the World and chose to live in it at its\nbeginning remain bound to it until its end. Though Melkor was eventually\nthrown into the Void by the others, he is prophesied to return before\nthe end in the DAGOR DAGORATH, the final battle. Little is known of the\nultimate future of the Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that\nafter the great battle at the end of the World, they will make a Second,\neven greater Music with the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nThe Line of Melian\n\nAmong the many Ainur who entered the World long ago, there was one of\nthe order of the Maiar named Melian. Alone of all the Ainur, she wedded\none of the Children of Ilúvatar, King Elu Thingol of Doriath, and wove\nthe Girdle of Melian that protected Doriath for many centuries. Through\nher, an essence of the Ainur entered the bloodlines of the Elves and\nMen, passed down through generation after generation, and was still\npresent at the time of the War of the Ring. Elrond was Melian's\ngreat-great-grandson, and Aragorn, too, was her descendant, though\nthrough many more generations than Elrond.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAINUR is a Quenyan word originating from Valarin and means “Holy ones”.\nIt appears to come from the word AINA, meaning 'holy'. Although the\norigin of the second element '''ur '''is less clear, it is possible\nthere is a link between the word 'Ainur' and the word 'Eru' as the first\nelement 'er' means 'one', though this may not be true as there is no\nfurther elaboration on this.\n\nThe singular form of Ainur is AINU, simply meaning “Holy one”.\n",

    "text": "The DWARVES OF THE IRON HILLS were Dwarves belonging to the house of the\nLongbeards, otherwise known as Durin's Folk, who lived in the Iron\nHills.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nThe Longbeard Dwarves of Khazad-dûm colonized the Iron Hills in the\nFirst Age. The Hills were their primary source of iron-ore. The\nDwarf-road of Mirkwood ran north-east from Khazad-dûm to the Hills for\nuse by dwarf-traders and merchants.\n\nAfter Sauron destroyed Eregion in the Second Age, the Longbeards sealed\nKhazad-dûm and Orcs took control of the northern Misty Mountains and the\nGrey Mountains. This ended communication between the Iron Hills and\nKhazad-dûm for some time.\n\nThird Age\n\nFounding of Grór's Realm\n\nIn the Third Age, many Longboard Dwarves lived in the Grey Mountains,\nbut they were greatly troubled by Dragons in that region. After King\nDáin I was slain by one of these dragons, his surviving sons led an\nexodus into the east. Dáin's elder son Thrór recreated the Kingdom under\nthe Mountain at Erebor, while his younger brother Grór led a part of the\npeople further into the east to join their kindred living in the Iron\nHills.\n\nGrór settled in the Iron Hills in the year TA 2590 and became Lord of\nthe Iron Hills. During his reign, the realm became the strongest in the\nNorth, being the only realm standing between Sauron and his plans to\ndestroy Rivendell and taking back the lands of Angmar. Also, following\nthe Sack of Erebor many of Durin's folk fleeing from Smaug and those\nwandering in exile, except for Thrór and his small company of family and\nfollowers, came to the Iron Hills, bolstering their numbers.\n\nWar of the Dwarves and Orcs\n\nDuring the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, many Dwarves from the Iron Hills\nfought several battles, but they are mostly remembered from the Battle\nof Azanulbizar in the year TA 2799. Naín and his army came to the battle\nin the most crucial moment when the main Dwarven army was being\ndecimated by the great host of Orcs. With these fresh reinforcements,\nthe Dwarves were able to route and destroy their opponents, fighting\ntheir way all up to the steps of the East-gate of Moria. There, Nain\ndueled with Azog, the Orc commander, resulting in his death. Later in\nthe battle, Dain II Ironfoot killed Azog out of vengeance for his\nfather, achieving recognition because he was very young by dwarven\nstandards. After this battle, Dain led his Dwarves back to Grór's Halls.\n\nDáin's Reign\n\nGrór ruled the Dwarves of the Iron Hills for 215 years, and he died in\nTA 2805 at 241 years of age. Dáin Ironfoot became the next Lord of the\nIron Hills. During his reign, the Iron Hills evolved to the mightiest\nDwarf-realm of its time.\n\nYears later, Dáin's cousin Thorin attempted to restore the kingdom at\nErebor, but he was trapped by the Elves of Mirkwood and Northmen of\nEsgaroth and sent to the Iron Hills for aid. Dáin arrived with over 500\narmored Dwarves and as events developed, the Dwarves of the Iron Hills\nproved crucial in winning the ensuing Battle of Five Armies against the\nOrcs of the Misty Mountains. Thorin died in that battle, and with him\nthe royal line of Thrór. Through his ancestor Grór, the Kingship of\nDurin's Folk then fell on Dáin. Dain II Ironfoot removed from the Iron\nHills and re-established a kingdom under the Lonely Mountain. It is\npossible that both Iron Hills and Erebor were ruled by him and later by\nhis son Thorin III Stonehelm.\n\nThe Dwarves of the Iron Hills fought alongside the Dwarves of Erebor in\nthe Battle of Dale against the Easterlings during the War of the Ring.\n\n\nOther information\n\nThey became well-known for making a metal mesh that could be used for\nmaking flexible items like leg-coverings.\n\nThese Dwarves of Durin's folk were known for being some of the most\nfierce and elite of all Dwarf armies capable of matching Sauron's army\non equal footing. Their main weapon of choice seemed to have been the\nmattocks, though they also carried a short broad sword with a round\nshield.\n\nNot much is said on whom were enemies of these dwarves, but it seems\nlikely that the Easterlings were one of them since their empire was near\nand around the Iron Hills, and possibly the Dragons that lived nearby in\nthe northern wastes.",

    "text": "The_' Haradrim, KNOWN IN WESTRON AS THE Southrons_' and once as the\n“SWERTINGS” by Hobbits, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of\nMiddle-earth directly south of Gondor. A part of the histories of the\nWestlands is given to the fierce people who in the Second and the Third\nAge of the Sun, came from the hot deserts and forests of sunlands, which\nlay in the South of Middle-earth. These people were ruled by many and\nlords, until in time Sauron the Maia corrupted them and called them to\nwar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Second Age the Men of Numenor built a great city in the firth\nof Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of the Bay of\nBelfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified citadel from\nwhose gates the Men of Numenor could levy great tributes upon many of\nthe tribes of Harad.\n\nFor many years, the Haradrim were the greatest enemy of Gondor. Several\ntimes, they invaded the north. Finally, the Men of Gondor were able to\ncapture Harad, though it was later freed. During the War of the Ring the\nHaradrim were allied with Sauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the 18,000 Haradrim were a great\nthreat to the Rohirrim that had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith.\nDuring the onslaught a Haradrim chieftain, who bore the standard of a\nblack serpent on a scarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden\nof Rohan slew him in single combat.\n\nOnce Sauron was destroyed, the Haradrim, Variags, and Easterlings\ndisbanded from the Black Gates and out of Mordor, and became dispersed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _HARADRIM_ means “South-people”, from the Sindarin _harad_\n(“south”) and _rim_ (“host, group”).\n\nOther names were SOUTHERNS, SOUTHRONS.\n\n\nTraits and culture\n\nThe Haradrim were bold and grim men, fierce in despair. They were tall\nand dark-skinned with black hair and dark eyes, and for that they were\ncalled SWERTINGS or SWARTHY MEN. The men of Near Harad were\nbrown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes, while the race known as\n“half-trolls” out of Far Harad had black skin.\n\nMany Haradrim warriors were seen in bright clothing, such as scarlet\nrobes, and were decorated with golden ornaments, such as collars,\nearrings, corsets of overlapping brazen plates; they braided their hair\nwith gold. Some tribes painted their bodies. Scarlet and red was also\nthe color of their banners, tips of their spears, and body paint. Their\nshields were yellow and black with spikes. It is also mentioned that\nat the end of the Second Age some of the Men in the south had weapons of\niron. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim bore\nscimitars that glittered like stars.\n\nThe Haradrim had tamed the massive _Mûmakil_ beasts and used them in\nwarfare and, like their masters, were decorated with scarlet and gold.\nThey even strapped towers on their backs, used by Haradrim archers and\nspearmen.\n\nHarad's tribes included into those of Near and Far Harad, although there\nwere many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Some of the\npeoples of Far Harad were organized into kingdoms.\n\nLanguage\n\nTo the Gondorians their voices sounded harsh, like shouts of beasts.\n\nThe only word which is stated to come from a southron language is\n“Mûmak”, the name of the great war-oliphaunts of Harad.\n\nGandalf states that his name in “the south” is “Incánus” thought\n_Inkā-nūsh_ (or possibly _Inkā-nūs_), meaning “North-spy”.\n\nDespite having a meaning in Quenya (“fate”), the name Umbar is said to\nbe adapted from the natives' language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nThe lands of the Haradrim lie to the south of Gondor past the river\nPoros. In the land south of Gondor, the sun beat down unrelentingly,\ncooking much of Haradwaith into desert.\n\n\nMilitary Tactics\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim are said to be skilled horsemen, though not near the\nprowess of the Rohirrim. They are known to have mounted champions and\narchers, as well as infantry. Horses fear the Mumakil, and so the\nSouthron forces often rally around them when faced with mounted foes.\n\n\nFuture of Harad\n\nMuch of Harad's impressive army was wiped out on the expanses of\nPelennor Fields, during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. With Sauron\ndefeated, many Harad peoples sent emissaries to the court of King\nAragorn, and peace talks began; however, many other Haradrim tribes\ncontinued hostility with Gondor.\n",

    "text": "NÚMENÓREANS were the scion of the Edain, the most noble race of Men\nduring the First Age. These men were given the island of Numenor at the\nbeginning of the Second Age by the Valar.\n\n\nOrigins\n\nAs mentioned, the Númenóreans were the descendants of the Edain, the\nElf-friends of the First Age. As a reward for their services during the\nWar of Wrath, the Valar gave them an island continent in the western sea\nwhich became Numenor as their abiding place. They also gifted with far\nlonger life (300 years or more average), greater height, and greater\nwisdom.\n\nNúmenor, which had been raised up by Ulmo, was shaped like a star upon\nthe ocean, and was in between Aman and Middle-earth. These Edain reached\nthe island in the year 32 S.A.. Elros, the brother of Elrond, was their\nfirst king.\n\n\nPhysical Characteristics\n\nBeing descendants of the Edain, the men of Numenor were well bred.\nExceptionally strong individuals were legendary.\n\nMost had dark hair, however lighter hairs (blondes) did exist. They were\nalso on average very tall; with Six foot, four inches being the average\namong them. Many far exceeded such height; Elendil himself being\nnicknamed “_ELENDIL THE TALL_” being over seven feet high. One\ncharacteristic that set them apart from typical men was their ages.\nNúmenóreans were not immortal as the Elves or Ainur, however in\ngratitude in their service during the War of the Wrath, they were\nblessed with extended lifespans averaging over 300 years. Bloodlines\nfrom the House of Elros could live for over 400-500. They aged slower\nthan their typical counterparts.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFrom the start, the friendship of the Númenóreans was between the\nDúnedain of the West and the Eldar of Eressëa. The white swan ships of\nthose Eldar brought many gifts to the Númenóreans: birds, trees, herbs,\nand more. Unfortunately, as time progressed, the kings of Numenor began\nto envy the Eldar for their immortality, and a fear of death infected\nthe island. Later on, kings fell dead, decrepit and witless, as they\nhopelessly clung to their lives. Thus faded the bliss of the\nNúmenóreans, if not their power. They had sailed the earth to the East\nin their wooden ships, and even glimpsed from their tall ship prows the\nGates of Morning, in the eastern continent. They founded many colonies\nin Mortal Lands, north and south, and there they ruled. With the gradual\ncreation of a colonial empire, the pride of the Kings grew. The old\ncustoms were for the most part abandoned; those that were kept were kept\nout of fear of the Valar. Most of the Númenóreans distanced themselves\nfrom the Eldar, and towards the end they persecuted any who were in\nfellowship with them. The 25th King, and also the last, Ar-Pharazôn, was\nmade angry by the reemerging Sauron in Mordor. The King sent a vast\narmy, so large and imposing that Sauron found himself deserted by his\nown armies, not a single large battle fought. But what Sauron could not\ncrush with his armies, he would manipulate with cunning mind and\nhoneyed-tongue. He prostrated himself before Pharazôn, and was taken\nprisoner. In less than three years, the Dark Lord had gone from\ntop-priority prisoner to the King's greatest councilor. All save one\n(Lord Amandil of Andúnië) of the Royal Council fawned on Sauron.\n\nAfter many years, the king felt the shadow of death near, and Sauron,\never the opportunist, seized his chance. He told the aging king of “The\nGiver of Freedom and Life” Melkor, behind closed doors. The king,\ndesperate to escape death, turned to the worship of the Dark. At\nSauron's urging, a great temple was built, and the tree Nimloth was cut\ndown, though not before Isildur, Amandil's grandson, escaped with a\nfruit of the tree. In the year 3310 SA, Sauron urged Pharazôn to take\nwhat the king desired for so long, the immortality of Aman. In 9 years,\na vast fleet was made ready, and Pharazôn, almost wavering, boarded his\nflagship, Alcarondas, and set sail. 39 days later, Numenor met with\napocalypse. The king had landed at Aman, and the Valar had ceded\nguardianship of Arda to Eru. Eru tore Aman away from the world, and\nformed the flat disc of Arda into a globe.  Numenor\nwas flooded, and its proud towers and walls crumbled. Sauron was taken\nunawares, and his last fair form was destroyed, and “as a gale” he\nescaped. Not all the Númenóreans were killed, however. Nine ships, led\nby Elendil son of Amandil escaped to the North of Middle-earth, and\nthere founded the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. The race of Black\nNúmenórean colonists existed far away in Harad still, as well as the\nrest of the Númenóreans' colonies.",

    "text": "RANGERS OF THE NORTH, or simply THE RANGERS, were the northern\nwandering people of Eriador, the last remnant of the Dunedain of Arnor,\nwho had once peopled the North Kingdom of Arnor. They protected the\nlands they wandered although their secretiveness made other peoples\nconsider them dangerous and distrustful in Bree and the Shire, where\nthey were known as “Watchers”.\n\nThey were grim in appearance and were usually dressed in grey or dark\ngreen, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a 6-pointed star.\n\nThe term 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived\nin the southern lands of Rohan and Gondor, perhaps to distinguish this\npeople from their distant cousins, the Rangers of Ithilien. Like the\nRangers of the North, these were also Dúnedain, but they belonged to the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the\nNorthern Dúnedain for some three thousand years.\n\n\nBackground\n\n The Dúnedain of\nArnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and the\nwars with Angmar. Cardolan and Rhudaur soon fell and only the\npetty-kingdom of Arthedain maintained the noble line of Isildur.\nFinally, that too was destroyed in the Battle of Fornost and Arvedui,\nthe last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea.\n\nArvedui's son and heir, Aranarth claimed the title of the Chieftain, who\nwould rule the remnants of his people. Elrond had in his keeping the\nheirlooms of the house of Isildur: the shards of Narsil, the Star of\nElendil, the Sceptre of Annúminas and later the Ring of Barahir,\nransomed from the Lossoth.\n\nEach of Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent back to\nIsildur himself) would be secretly born and raised in Rivendell.\n\nThe Rangers became a secretive wandering and nomadic people around\nEriador, far from Sauron's spies, little known or remembered, and their\ndeeds were seldom recorded.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Watchful Peace followed the loss of Arnor and after its end, the\nenemies concentrated mostly against Rhovanion and Gondor. During that\ntime, the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against orcs and\nwolves in order to keep the region safe. The hobbits of the Shire\nflourished under their protection.\n\nDuring the rule of Arassuil, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains became more\nbold, daring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying\nto hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were\nfought off by a party of brave Hobbits under Bandobras Took in T.A.\n2747. Soon after, the Long Winter arrived and many lives were lost, and\nGandalf and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire survive.\n\nIn 2911, during Argonui's rule, the Fell Winter began with the\nBrandywine freezing over. This was a catalyst for White Wolves invading\nEriador from the North which must have harassed the Rangers. In the last\nyear of his reign, great floods devastated Enedwaith and Minhiriath\nleaving Tharbad ruined and deserted. The following years were peaceful\nalthough Arador was killed by hill-trolls and his son Arathorn II was\nkilled while hunting orcs.\n\nArathorn's son, Aragorn II succeeded him, who between 2957 to 2980 took\ngreat journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and\nSteward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks weakened Sauron and\nhis allies, and the West endured him during the War of the Ring.\n\nAt that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and diminished. When\nHalbarad led a troop of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in\nthe War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty in this company\nwho fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields.\n\nAragorn eventually became King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom and the\nRangers became once more a united people under the line of Elendil in\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFor over a thousand years, the Rangers of the North faithfully preserved\nthe Line of Elendil and the ways of the Dúnedain and the ancient\nheirlooms of the Heir of Isildur such as the Shards of Narsil, Star of\nElendil, Sceptre of Annúminas, and the Ring of Barahir. Like all\nDúnedain, they were very friendly with the Elves, particularly those of\nRivendell, where each heir would be born and raised. They secretly\nguarded and protected Eriador, from spies and invaders, brigands, and\nother worse foes.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, the Rangers of the North were led by\nAragorn, future king of the reunited kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. But\ndespite Aragorn's leadership, most of the Rangers remained scattered and\ndiminished. Therefore, when the ranger Halbarad endeavored to aid\nAragorn in the War, he could muster only a small number of Rangers to\njoin him."

    "text": "The EDAIN (sing. ADAN) also known as ATANATÁRI, FATHERS OF MEN, and_'\nThree Houses of Men_', are a group of Men that came to the Beleriand\nfrom the Far East during the First Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early fourth century of the First Age the Edain, drawn towards\nthe Light of the West, came into Beleriand where they befriended the\nelves, entered their service, received land and title for that service,\nand fought valiantly in the Battles of Beleriand. Some, however,\nremained in Estolad or fled south or east from the power of Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and passed from history until the Third Age. Despite their\nmighty heroes, the Edain were decimated by the hordes of Morgoth, but\none of their numbers, Eärendil of the House of Hador, sailed to Aman and\nobtained from the Valar the aid by which Morgoth was defeated in the\nLast Battle. The remnant of the Edain, now increased in body and mind by\nEönwë, then sailed to Numenor and became known as Númenóreans and later\nthe Dúnedain who came to live in Middle-earth in the Realms in Exile\nafter the Fall of Numenor.\n\n\nThree Houses of Man\n\nThey were divided into three tribes, or “Houses”:\n\n1.) The HOUSE OF BËOR: they were dark-haired and stoutly built, and most\nresembled the Ñoldor of all Elves. They were first discovered by Finrod\nFelagund, Lord of Nargothrond, and under his guidance later made their\nway to the lands of the Ñoldorin lord Amrod, in a place later known as\nEstolad, the Encampment. They remained loyal to the House of Finarfin,\nand later settled in the lands of Dorthonion.\n\n2.) The Second House, later known as the HALADIN or the HOUSE OF HALETH:\nThey were a reclusive folk, dark-haired but smaller in stature than the\nBëorians. They usually kept separate from the other Men, and were later\ngranted permission to settle in the Forest of Brethil, part of Doriath.\nThey mostly kept out of the wars.\n\n3.) The HOUSE OF MARACH, later best known as the HOUSE OF HADOR: They\nwere originally led by Marach but later took the name of Hador in honor\nof him. Tall and golden-haired, they most resembled the Vanyar of the\nelves. They were a very numerous and war-like tribe, and the Green Elves\nof Ossiriand feared them. They first settled in Estolad, then in the\nsouthern parts of Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow), and then later in\nDor-lómin. They were loyal to Fingolfin.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe Edain were tall, fair, and strong; their spirits were noble, they\nwere fierce in war, and they shunned all dealings with evil. In\nBeleriand the Edain loved the Eldar, from whom they learned much wisdom,\nand they were further ennobled by the two marriages of Elda and Adan:\nBeren and Lúthien and Tuor and Idril. The lifespan of the Edain before\nthey entered Beleriand was probably about 70 years; in Beleriand, it was\nlengthened to 90, but few of the Edain lived to old age in peace.\n\n\nLanguage\n\nThe language of the Edain (at least those of the First and Third Houses)\nwas related to Adûnaic, but in Beleriand, most of the Edain spoke\nSindarin, and so the tongue of the Haladin was alien to them.\n\n\nFate of the Edain\n\nThe House of Bëor was nearly wiped out by Morgoth, and the remainder of\nits people merged with the Hadorians and became the Númenóreans. It\nwould seem that the Haladin of Beleriand were completely wiped out, or\nat least disappeared as a separate people.\n\nWhen they returned as Númenóreans to Middle-earth in the Second Age,\nthey encountered many men who were obviously related to the Atani: they\nclassified these men as _Middle Men_, and established friendly relations\nwith them. Examples are the Rohirrim, the Men of Dale, and the\nBreelanders.\n\nOther men, such as the Dunlendings, were not recognised as Middle Men\nbecause they were related to the Haladin rather than Bëorians or\nMarachians, and they were hostile to Numenor.\n\nA fourth kind of men came with the Second House, and called themselves\n_Drughu_. This name was adopted in Sindarin as _Drúedain_:\n_Drû_+_Edain_. They were a strange people, living with the Haladin in\nthe forest of Brethil, some even apparently made it to Numenor, but they\ndied out or had left before the Akallabêth. In the Third Age, their far\nkin were known as the _Woses_ of the Drúadan Forest. They had dwindled\nto a very small number and were secretive but were renowned for the\nassistance they gave to the Rohirrim in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin word _Edain_, singular _Adan_ (Quenya _Atani_, _Atan_),\nliterally meant _Second People_, and originally referred to all men, but\nlater it only applied to the Men of Beleriand and their descendants. The\nQuenya term _Atani_ kept its old meaning.",

Vanyar are the fairest and most noble of the High Elves. Under the\nleadership of Ingwë, the Vanyar were the first to set forth on the Great\nJourney and the first to reach the shores of Belegaer; they sailed to\nAman on the first voyage of Tol Eressëa and remained there permanently.\n\n\n\nThe Vanyar are the fairest of all the elves hence their name: the FAIR\nELVES. Unlike the others who were attracted to the sea or the building\nand forging of things, the Vanyar culture seemed to revolve about Valar\nand Valinor. This is probably the reason why they choose to stay in\nValinor proper centered around Taniquetil, the seat of the rulers of\nArda, and loved the light of Valinor best of all the other places in\nAman and the wisdom of the Valar, and why they were favored by Manwë and\nVarda and always distrusted Melkor. They are known to have had the\ngreatest skill in poetry of all the Elves, likened to Manwë who loves\nthem for it. Their hair colour was golden and their banners white.\n\nIngwë was their king.\n\n\nHistory\n\nVanyar are descendants of Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his\nwife Iminyë, and six other pairs of Elves who were awoken by them.\nImin's companions, Tata and Enel, later awoke groups of nine and twelve\npairs respectively, and Imin decided that since his group was now the\nsmallest and each group that he and his companions discovered was larger\nthan the last, he would now choose third rather than first in order to\nmake up the numbers. However, only a further two groups were discovered,\nleaving Imin's group of fourteen by far the smallest of the three Elven\nclans.\n\nWhen the Elves were discovered by Oromë, each clan chose an ambassador\nto return with him to Valinor to verify his claims of its greatness. The\nMinyar (Imin's companions) sent Ingwë. Upon his return, his people were\nswayed by his testimony and adopted him as their king (appropriate, as\nthe name Ingwë means chieftain in Quenya), and he led them with Oromë to\nAman. Ingwë has since been reckoned the High King of all Elves, and\nbecame known as Ingwë Ingweron, the “Chief of Chieftains”, and his\npeople were known by the rest of the Eldar as the Vanyar. In Aman the\nVanyar first dwelt in Tirion. Later, they came to love the full light of\nthe Trees and wandered into Valinor or settled on Taniquetil. He dwells\nwith them on the slopes of Taniquetil, beneath the halls of Manwë.\n\nAfter arriving in Aman, the Vanyar were rarely seen even by other Elves.\nVery few individual Vanyar are named besides Imin, Ingwë, his sister (or\npossibly niece) Indis, and Amarië, who was in love with Finrod Felagund.\n\n☀, Indis, the second wife of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and the\nmother of both Fingolfin and Finarfin, the latter of which founded the\nonly house of Noldorin Elves to sport golden Vanyarin hair. After her\nhusband was killed by Melkor in his attack on Formenos to attain the\nSilmarils , she returned to her people with her daughter Findis.\n\nUnlike the Noldor, the Vanyar loved the light of Valinor so much that\nthey never choose to return to Middle-earth save when many of the Vanyar\nmarched in the War of Wrath with the Host of Valinor. Though they\npreferred the peaceful light of Valinor, the Vanyar were skilled in the\narts of war and were known for their fashioning of spears, thus they\nno doubt fielded a formidable army in the war. Ingwë's son led an armed\nhost of his people from Valinor to fight in the War of Wrath. They\nreturned to Aman, along with most of the Eldar living in the now largely\ndestroyed Beleriand, at the end of the First Age.\n\n\nRelations\n\nGaladriel was the granddaughter of Indis. It is to her Vanyarin blood\nthat Galadriel owes her famous silver-gold hair.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Vanyar_ means 'Fair-ones' in Quenya , referring to their\ngolden hair. The Vanyar often called themselves MINYAR; IPA: ; “Firsts”;\nsingular MINYA; adjectival MINYARIN; ), their ancient name. This ancient\nname does not still refer to any of the Avari who remained in\nMiddle-earth, since all of the Vanyar heeded the call of the Valar to\ncome to Valinor.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn the earliest versions of Tolkien's mythology (see: _The History of\nMiddle-earth_), they were called INGWI, as they were the people of\nIngwë, the High King of the Elves.\n\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Indis the Fair by vigshane.jpg|Indis the Fair, the wife of Finwë,\nthe first High King of the Ñoldor and Queen of the Ñoldor, by Filat\nImage:Amarie of the vanyar by Filat.jpg|Amarie, the love of Finrod, by\nFilat",

    "text": "DUNLENDINGS, also known as\nWILDMEN OF DUNLAND, were the people of Dunland. They were known as a\nfierce culture of Men who sought vengeance on the people of Rohan who,\nas Saruman rightly said, drove them into the mountains. In _The Two\nTowers_, Saruman used their anger to manipulate and convince them to\ndestroy the land of Rohan during the War of the Ring. He sends them\nacross Rohan, burning and looting the land.\n\nDunlending Wildmen come from the land of Dunland. When looting Rohan\nearlier in the Third Age, they are led by a Dunlending named Wulf son of\nFreca.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nIn the years of the Second Age before the Númenóreans settled in\nMiddle-earth, the tribal Hill-men inhabited the lands west and south of\nthe Misty Mountains, as far down as the valleys surrounding the White\nMountains.\n\nWary of the men who came out of the west, they came to fear and hate\nthem. They were hunted and persecuted in such numbers that they had\ndwindled by the start of the Third Age. At this time they had come to\ncongregate in the valleys of the White Mountains and the grassy plains\nof Dunland, which lay west of the Misty Mountains between Moria and\nIsengard; a few went north, and became the ancestors of the Men of Bree.\nDunland then became the area most populated by these men, who came to be\ncalled Dunlendings.\n\n\n\nWhen Eorl and his people were granted Calenardhon --- Rohan, as it would\nlater be known --- in TA 2510, they drove the Wild Men from their new\nlands, earning their bitter hatred and enmity. The Wild Men were also\ndriven from the White Mountains by the Men of Gondor. During the next\nfive hundred years these shorter, dark-haired warriors made frequent\nattacks upon the outlying settlements of Rohan, exacting revenge upon\nthe usurpers, whom they called “straw-heads” because of the high number\nof blond warriors among them.\n\nAs a consequence, Rohan maintained patrols and garrisons to the west of\nthe Fords of Isen to try to limit the number of raids, although these\npatrols had virtually disappeared under Wormtongue's stewardship, to the\npoint where Saruman's forces could make incursions almost at will.\n\nYet not everybody took against the Wild Men. At some point near the end\nof the thirtieth century of the Third Age, Saruman made contact with\nthem and swayed them to his side by playing on their resentment and\nhatred of those who had taken what was theirs.\n\nSaruman welcomed to Orthanc a large warband of these Dunlendings.\nSaruman evidently convinced them that they could reclaim what had been\ntaken, and during the early part of TA 3019, a fearsome raiding force\ncomprising Dunlendings, Orcs and Uruk-hai left Isengard and began\nravaging the western settlements of Rohan. Previous attacks by Orcs and\nUruk-hai had killed many Rohirrim at the Fords of Isen, so there were no\nwarriors to defend against the surprise attack.\n\n\n\nMany people of Rohan were killed in these attacks, but the raiders never\nmade it across the country to Edoras; it is fair to assume that they\nencountered one or more Éoreds, companies of mounted warriors, who would\nhave been patrolling the interior. After the defeat of Isengard at the\nBattle of the Hornburg, the Rohirrim spared the surviving Dunlendings\nand used them as workmen to repair the broken walls of the Hornburg.\n\nThe Rohirrim's mercy surprised the Dunlendings, as Saruman had convinced\nthem the Rohirrim would slaughter them all if given the chance. When\nGandalf, Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and Pippin Took\nwere traveling through Dunland on their way back towards the the Shire,\nthe Dunlendings in that area hid from them. After the War of the Ring,\nthe Dunlendings sent ambassadors to the court of King Aragorn, thus\nfinally began peace and diplomacy between Gondor and Rohan with the\nDunlending realms.\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Dunlendings were hill-folk used to living in harsh conditions, often\nseen in leather garb and fur cloaks. They may have been related to the\nSnowmen of Forochel in the north. They were a tough, hardy people, big\nand powerful with long, unkempt hair and beards. The Dunlendings,\nbecause they lived in the hilly and forested area of Dunland, most\nlikely hunted, foraged, and fished for food, with agriculture being a\nlesser form of food production.\n\nThe Dunlendings, due to their way of life, probably were very skilled\nwith bows. Dunlendings are also described as using cavalry at the Fords\nof Isen. Most Dunlendings probably fought, however, on foot, with long\nspears, axes and other melee weapons (as with most self-arming forces,\nswords were expensive and therefore a rarity).  Armour for most soldiers\nwas light, but well-off warriors and chieftains likely made use of\nchainmail and were clad similarly as their Rohirrim counterparts.\n",

    "text": "SILVAN ELVES (also known as '''Woodland Elves ''') are a subgroup of\nthe Nandor, and are thus ultimately of Telerin origin. As Úmanyar, they,\nlike the Sindar, began the Great Journey but did not complete it. In the\nThird Age, most remaining Silvan Elves lived either in Lothlórien or in Northern Mirkwood of the\nWoodland Realm.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Silvan Elves were of Nandorin background, descended from the\nfollowers of Lenwë, who were fascinated by the landscape East of the\nMisty Mountains and afraid to attempt to cross them. They thus abandoned\nthe Great Journey, choosing instead to remain in those wide forests,\nwhere they became a scattered people.\n\nLittle is known of the wanderings of the Nandor, save that they spread\nthroughout the Vales of Anduin over a period of many centuries, some\nfollowing the Great River southward, eventually settling at the Mouths\nof Anduin or instead turning north again into Eriador, where eventually\nDenethor gathered as many as he could and crossed the Blue Mountains\ninto Beleriand. These were later known as the Green-Elves of Ossiriand,\nand were welcomed by Thingol as long lost kin.\n\nSome of the Nandor however stayed in the forested Vales, and these would\nbecome the Silvan Elves - hidden away in their woodland fastnesses and\nwere to their estranged kin hardly distinguishable from the Avari, and\nindeed sometimes living in friendship with them. Their language had\ndiverged to such an extent that it was barely intelligible to the Sindar\nand Noldor when these met the Silvan Elves again in the Second Age,\nthough the languages were found to be obviously related. It was not\nuntil this renewed contact between the kindreds and the guidance of the\nSindar and Noldor that the Silvan Elves again became an organised people\nand increased in wisdom. This however also led to the Silvan tongue\nbeing largely forgotten, Sindarin instead becoming the primary spoken\nlanguage by the end of the Third Age, with the Silvan dialects only\nsurviving in several names of places and persons. \n\nThe renewed contact was caused by the destruction of Beleriand after the\nWar of Wrath, for when the Second Age was young, the Silvan Elves\nwelcomed those survivors of the calamity who rather than crossing the\nSea rejoined their kindred east of the Misty Mountains. Indeed soon\nmany of the Silvan Elves came to be ruled by these Sindar refugees,\nprimarily in Lothlórien and the Woodland Realm.\n\nThe Woodland Realm\n\nThe primarily Silvan Elves of Mirkwood were known to be distrustful of\nDwarves but friendly to Men, with whom they traded. Mirkwood had been\ncalled Greenwood the Great until around the year TA 1050, when the\nshadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it, and men began to call it\nMirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins had\nto rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company from these\nElves. These Elves sent hosts to both the War of the Last Alliance\nand the Battle of the Five Armies.\n\nLegolas of the Fellowship of the Ring, although he lived among them was\nnot truly one of the Silvan folk. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil,\nwhose father Oropher had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was\nlikely actually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's side\n(his mother's identity being unknown).\n\nIt is important to note that while by the end of the Third Age, Sindarin\nhad become the primary language of the Woodland Realm, Silvan being\nalmost completely forgotten, that in the early years of the Sindarin\nrule over the Silvan Elves here, the Sindar for a time “deliberately”\nadopted the language and customs of the Silvan Elves, as “they wished to\nreturn to the simple life natural to the elves before the invitation of\nthe Valar had disturbed it”. \n\nLórien\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Lórien were the larger part of the Galadhrim or the\nTree-people, who were a mixture of elves of Nandor, Noldor, and Sindar\ndescent. Most of the Sindar that came to Lórien were refugees from\nBeleriand, arriving early in the Second Age, and the Sinda Amdír became\nthe King of Lórien. After Amdír was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad,\nhis son Amroth became King.\n\nAfter the destruction of Eregion, they were joined by many Sindarin\nspeaking Noldor, led by Galadriel and Celeborn, who fled to Lórien\nthrough Moria. Galadriel was of Noldor descent, being the daughter of\nFinarfin, while Celeborn was of Sindarin descent of the Kingdom of\nDoriath. When Amroth was lost in the Third Age, Galadriel and Celeborn\nbecame known as the Lady and Lord of Lórien, but neither of them took\nthe vacant Kingship.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of\nSindarin which had changed so much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke some\nSindarin, could not understand them. Additionally, few elves of Lórien\ncould speak Westron, so that Haldir, one of the few that could, had to\naccompany them on their way to Caras Galadhon.\n",

    "text": "The NORTHMEN, also known as the FREE MEN OF THE NORTH,''' '''were Men\nthat lived in the north of Rhovanion in Middle-earth, and were friendly\nto Gondor.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nThe Northmen who dwelt in the Greenwood and other parts of Rhovanion\nwere friendly to the Dúnedain and were, after the Dúnedain, some of the\nmost noble Men in Arda. They were known as Middle Men by the Dúnedain,\nand were believed to have been descended from the same group of Men as\nthe Edain, the Atanatári. The only difference was that they didn't cross\nthe Blue Mountains into Beleriand, and therefore did not journey to\nNúmenor. The result of them not participating in the War against Morgoth\nwas their considerably shorter lifespan; the lifespan of the Dúnedain\nbeing lengthened by the Valar after the War of Wrath. They were\nimportant allies of Gondor and served as a buffer against the\nEasterlings and other foes. For a time many of them even became subjects\nof Gondor, as the realm extended beyond the river Anduin.\n\nEast of Greenwood the Great was the kingdom of Rhovanion, and this\nbecame the most important nation of the Northmen. In the fourteenth\ncentury of the Third Age, King Rómendacil II of Gondor sent his son\nValacar as an ambassador to Vidugavia, the so-called “King of\nRhovanion”. Valacar loved Rhovanion and the daughter of the King,\nVidumavi. He married her and she bore him a son whom she called\n_Vinitharya_ in her mother tongue. In Gondor, Vinitharya became known as\nKing Eldacar and caused a civil war- the Kin-strife- because of his\nmixed Dúnedain/Northmen blood.\n\nShortly after the death of Vidugavia, a small group of Northmen moved to\nthe vales of the Anduin between the Gladden Fields and the Mirkwood,\nprobably to flee from the Wainriders, who had enslaved much of the\npeople of Rhovanion. After the evil Kingdom of Angmar was defeated by\nGondor and the remains of Arnor in TA 1977, these Northmen moved north\nand began to call themselves the Éothéod. They were skilled horse\nbreeders and horsemen. In TA 2510 they responded to a plea of help from\nthe trapped Gondor army at the Field of Celebrant. After they helped\nGondor win this important victory, they were rewarded the province of\nCalenardhon and became known as the Rohirrim. The Men of Rohan who\nfought on foot were called 'Yeomen'.\n\nThe Men of Dale and Lake-town were also counted under the Northmen, as\nwere the woodsmen of Mirkwood. Most of Rhovanion had been depopulated\nafter the wars of the Easterlings and the Great Plague. Their range was\nextremely wide; the Men of the North ranged to the western eaves of\nMirkwood to the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains and from the Long\nLake to Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhun.\n\nIn ''the Hobbit, ''these men carved out a potentially precarious living\nin the eaves of Mirkwood, living as hunters, loggers, trappers, and\nfishermen on the Anduin and its tributaries. They also lived in constant\nfear of attack from Dol Guldur.\n\n\nMilitary\n\nThe larger, more established kingdoms of the North (such as Dale and\nLaketown) would have at least some semblance of a regular standing army.\nThese would have mostly consisted of a force of dismounted men-at-arms,\narmed with a sword and a wooden shield. The Men of the North might have\nreceived some help from Gondor in metalworking, along with their Dwarven\nallies nearby. A militia or town guard would have also been used\nextensively, for the majority of the humans in the north were farmers\nand thus needed their full attention kept on the all-important harvest.\n\nFurther up the military hierarchy would be a force of axemen, for many\nof the woodcutters and loggers in Mirkwood would have learned to use the\naxe from adolescence.\n\nA force of mounted knights and light cavalry would probably have been\navailable for scouting and other duties, for the terrain from Dale to\nDorwinion is mostly flat and featureless, except for a few trees,\nshrubs, and ponds scattered randomly.\n\nBy contrast, the rural, less established kingdom of Rohan trains almost\nevery legitimate soldier it has to fight from horseback, while the\ninfantry division is left to be composed of not soldiers but, as Gamling\nstates in The Two Towers, “every villager able to wield a sword”.\n\n\nLanguages\n\nBeing human means that the Northmen spoke the Common Speech. However,\nthey also have native languages. For example, the Rohirrim spoke\nRohirric, for which Tolkien appears to have been inspired by Old\nEnglish, seeing names like “Éowyn” and “Thengel”. Whereas the Bardings\nand Wood-men speak a similar language to the men of Rohan in terms of\ngross language group, as seen in Old Norse names (akin to Old English\nand Norse being in the same language group), i.e. the name “Brand”\ntranslating to “torch”. The language was not similar to Dwarvish; rather\nthe Dwarf names appearing in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_\nare Dwarf names given in the language of the Men of Dale, not the native\nDwarf language.  They never shared languages with the Elves or with\ntheir Western, Southern, and Eastern counterparts; other than Westron."

    "text": "The ARMY OF THE DEAD, also known as the DEAD MEN OF DUNHARROW or\nOATHBREAKERS, were Men of the White Mountains, cursed to remain in\nMiddle-earth by Isildur after they abandoned their oath to aid him in\nthe War of the Last Alliance. They haunted the caverns beneath the\nDwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though\nthey were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or\ndeath. They were led by the King of the Dead, the most fearsome and\nterrifying of the whole Dead Army. Since the line of Isildur had “ended”\n(after a couple of hundred years), no one could call upon the Dead Army\nto aid them in their hours of need, as they would only answer to an Heir\nof Isildur. It wasn't until the Third Age in the War of The Ring that\nAragorn, Isildur's heir, would call upon them to fight with him against\nSauron, fulfilling their oath and releasing them from their curse.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThey were once_' Men of the White Mountains_', but at the founding of\nGondor, they swore an oath to Isildur that they would fight for him.\nHowever, during the dark years, they had worshiped Sauron, and so when\nthe time came and Isildur asked for their aid, they refused and so\nIsildur cursed them saying: _Thou shalt be the last king, and if the\nwest prove mightier than thy Black Master, this curse I lay upon thee\nand thy folk; to rest never until your oath is fulfilled. For this war\nwill last through years uncounted, and you shall be summoned once again\nere the end._ Therefore, they fled from the wrath of Isildur and dared\nnot go forth to war for Sauron, and they hid in secret places in the\nmountains and had no dealings with other men. They slowly started to\ndwindle and the terror of the Sleepless Dead came about to all the\nplaces where they lingered.\n\n[Depiction of the Army of the Dead meeting Aragorn]\n\nMalbeth the Seer prophesied that a day would come when need and haste\nwould drive one of Isildur's heirs to take The Road under the Mountain,\nand that the dead would answer to his call. The Prophecy came true. In\nthe War of the Ring, Isildur's Heir, Aragorn, called on the Dead Men.\nSummoning them to the Stone of Erech, Aragorn commanded them to fulfill\ntheir oath and be free.\n\nAragorn led the Army of the Dead through Lamedon and Ciril. As they went\nthrough the lands of Gondor, they found them deserted, since everyone\nwho hadn't gone to war fled the approach of the dreaded “King of the\nDead”. Even the men of Umbar and Harad, who had been attacking the fords\nat Linhir above the mouth of the river Gilrain, stopped fighting and ran\noff in terror. The only person who had the courage to stay was Angbor,\nthe Lord of Lamedon, and Aragorn told him to gather his men and follow\nthe Grey Company to Pelargir. For four days and nights after Aragorn\nfirst summoned the dead to the Stone of Erech, they rode.\n\n\n\nOn the fifth day they reached their destination (Pelargir), where the\nmain fleet of Umbar was assembled. Some of the ships had set sail for\nMinas Tirith already because rumor of the dead army had reached the\nhavens. In spite of these rumors, however, the Haradrim whom the Company\nhad been pursuing turned at bay and laughed, seeing only Aragorn and his\nhost of live Dunedain warriors, as the dead were hanging back behind\nthem to surprise their foes. Aragorn then called to the Army of the Dead\nto fight, which resulted in a bloody battle. Legolas later, after the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields, described the scene he witnessed to\nMeriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took: _Faint cries I heard, and dim\nhorns blowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it was like the\necho of some forgotten battle in the Dark Years long ago. Pale swords\nwere drawn; but I know not whether their blades would still bite, for\nthe Dead needed no longer any weapon but fear._ Even though not needing\nweapons, the weapons of the Enemy could not harm them.\n\nThe Army of the Dead attacked first the ships that were still anchored,\nand then walked over the water to the ones that had set sail. The\nterrified Corsairs abandoned their ships and jumped overboard; all\neither drowned or headed south back to their homelands. Once the\nHaradrim and Corsairs were defeated, Aragorn had trumpets sounded and\nthe dead withdrew to the shore. As they had at last fulfilled their\noath, Aragorn granted the Dead Army their freedom. The King of the Dead\nstepped forward, broke his spear, and threw it away; he bowed to Aragorn\nand the dead vanished at last from the world.\n\n\nInspiration\n\nNorthern European folklore tells of 'the restless dead' as fell riders\nbursting upon unwary travellers in lonely places. Horses, knights,\nhounds are among the restless spirits in the “Wild Hunt”. Hans Sachs'\npoem, “Das wutend heer der kleinen dieb” (1539) describes the furious\nhost in gruesome detail, accompanied by ravens who plucked out the eyes\nof the roving dead: “there came one behind, who had been hanged the same\nday, had still his eyes and saw me.”\n\nIt is an indication of Aragorn's heroic nature and lineage that he dares\nsummon the dead to fulfill their oath in this manner, and a sign that\nthe rightful king has indeed returned.",

Two Maiar came: Curumo (or Curunir; later known as\nSaruman) sent by Aulë, and Alatar (Morinehtar), sent by Oromë. Manwë\nasked where Olórin (later known as Gandalf) was, and he came, after\nreturning from a journey. Manwë asked Olórin if he would go as the third\nmessenger. Olórin said he was too weak and that he was afraid of Sauron;\nhowever, Manwë said that was all the more reason to go, and that he\ncommanded Olórin to go as the third. Then Varda said, “Not as the\nthird.” Yavanna begged Curumo to take Aiwendil (Radagast), and Alatar\ntook Pallando (Rómestámo) as a friend. They were forbidden to dominate\nthe free peoples of Middle-earth or to match Sauron's power with power.\nWhen Saruman, the greatest of the Wizards, disobeyed this injunction, he\nwas cast from the order and banished from ever returning to Valinor.\n\nThe Wizards were known by various names and were arrayed in different\ncolors. Of those who came to Middle-earth, sent by the Valar, five are\nknown, the Heren Istarion (Order of Wizards). After arriving in\nMiddle-earth, the two Blue Wizards apparently went east before the War\nof the Ring; whether they played a part in the events of that war is\nunknown. (Note: _According to Tolkien's letters they may have formed\ncults for magic worship and practice among the Easterlings._) Radagast\nthe Brown concerned himself mainly with plants and animals and lived in\nMirkwood for many years. Saruman the White and Gandalf the Grey spent\ntime with the Free Peoples: the Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Saruman was\nwise and respected and became head of the White Council in TA 2463.\nHowever, he became prideful and jealous of the potential and purity of\nspirit of Gandalf, who would eventually surpass him in power. Saruman\nslowly came to betray the original purpose of the Wizards and sought\npower for himself. He was overthrown during the War of the Ring, by his\ntormented servant, Grima Wormtongue. Grima slit Saruman's neck after a\nfailed attempt to rule the Shire. Saruman's spirit looked to the West\nand Valinor but was blown away.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Wizards passed from sight; since, with\nthe fall of Sauron, their work was done. Gandalf passed over the Sea\nwith the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings. Saruman became a naked\nspirit and wandered Middle-earth forever since he was banished from\nValinor. Radagast stayed in Middle-earth, tending to the wilderness. The\nfate of the Blue Wizards is unknown.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe wizards bore the forms of old Men; they were ancient and seemed to\nage very slowly. They possessed the great skill of body and mind; the\ngreater portion of their power as Maiar resided in their staffs. Each of\nthe Istari had his color and grade within the Order. Saruman the White\nwas the eldest and Gandalf the Grey second. The other Istari was\nRadagast the Brown and the two Blue Wizards, who dwelt far in the east.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Istari_ is a Quenya word (singular _Istar_). The Sindarin\ntranslation is ''Ithryn ''(singular _Ithron_).\n\n\nNamed wizards\n\n-   CURUMO, the White Wizard, was more commonly known as SARUMAN.\n    However, after being seduced by the evil power of Sauron, Saruman\n    became the Many-Coloured Wizard.\n    -   Saruman (human form) was killed by Gríma Wormtongue following\n        the Battle of Bywater, and Gandalf returned to the Undying Lands\n        in TA 3021. However, the fates of the three other Istari are\n        relatively unknown. Alatar and Pallando disappeared in the east,\n        while Radagast stayed in Middle-earth until at least TA 3018.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   OLÓRIN, the Grey Wizard, was more commonly known as GANDALF.\n    However, after dying at the hands of a Balrog, Durin's Bane, Gandalf\n    was reborn as the new White Wizard.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   AIWENDIL, the Brown Wizard, was more commonly known as RADAGAST.\n    Radagast was a lover of nature and so did not play any major part in\n    the War of the Ring except for announcing to the Great Eagles that\n    Gandalf was at the Orthanc with Saruman.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   ALATAR AND PALLANDO, the Blue Wizards, little is known about them,\n    although Gandalf suspected they may have founded a few magical cults\n    in the east, it is not expressed why he thinks this, although\n    perhaps he noted some strange similarities of knowledge from Maia\n    and knowledge of those cults/teachings (_Note: Later in his life,\n    Tolkien wrote a note, suggesting that the names of the Blue Wizards\n    were Morinehtar and Rómestámo.

    "text": "The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was formed as a brotherhood among members of\nthe various Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Its purpose was to take the\nOne Ring to Mordor that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom,\nthe mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed and\nultimately kill the Dark Lord Sauron.\n\nThe '''Fellowship '''was also known as the COMPANY OF THE RING, the NINE\nWALKERS, or more simply the COMPANY. Each of the members of the Company\nwere representatives of their respective races, with Legolas and Gimli\nbeing the only Elf and Dwarf chosen.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\n\nFormed after the Council of Elrond, the Fellowship consisted of nine\nmembers: four Hobbits, two Men, one Elf, one Dwarf, and one Wizard. It\nis the only known organisation/group ever formed in the history of\nMiddle-earth, to hold members of each of these races within it (and with\nthe departure of the Elves and the Wizards from Middle-earth, there\nwould never be another like it), who largely lived and acted\nindependently of one another (or in the case of Elves and Dwarves, felt\nactive animosity toward each other). This number was chosen to match the\nnumber of Ring Wraiths, also known as Black Riders, the Nazgúl or the\nNine Riders. Merry and Pippin were never intended to be a part of the\nFellowship, with Elrond considering two Elf-lords from his own house. He\nwished to send the two younger hobbits back to the Shire as messengers\nto warn other Hobbits of the growing evil. However, the Halflings\npersevere: Merry is chosen and Gandalf convinces Elrond of the loyalty\nof Pippin.\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was formed by Elrond after the Council of\nElrond. The Fellowship, being led mainly by Gandalf, headed down the\npath to Mordor.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey south from Rivendell, and a\nnear-catastrophic attempt to cross over the Misty Mountains, the\nFellowship descended into Moria. In the former Dwarf-kingdom, they found\nevidence that Orcs had slain Gimli's kinsman Balin and other Dwarves who\nhad returned there. They were soon confronted by the Balrog known as\n_Durin's Bane_, who had many Orc and Troll minions under his control.\nGandalf fell facing this menace, and the Company was forced to go on\nwithout him.\n\nOnce they escaped Moria, the Fellowship headed to the Elven forest of\nLothlórien where they spoke with the Elven Lord Celeborn and Galadriel,\nLady of Light. Galadriel supplied them each with special Elven Gifts\nfrom Lothlórien, boats and supplies so that they could travel down the\nriver Anduin. This route was quicker than an overland march, but the\ngroup was attacked by Orc archers and shadowed by Gollum, who had begun\nfollowing them in Moria.\n\nForced to portage their boats around the waterfall called Rauros, the\nFellowship soon ran into difficulties. Boromir finally succumbed to\ntemptation, and attempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. This led to\nFrodo using the Ring to escape and he and Sam leaving to spare the\nothers the lure of it. The repentant Boromir died trying to defend Merry\nand Pippin against a large force of Uruks from Isengard.\n\nThe Fellowship was dissolved on the banks of the Anduin that day. Frodo\nand Sam carried on towards Mordor; Boromir was given funerary rites and\nsent floating over the falls, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli departed on\ntheir way to save Merry and Pippin.\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\n\nAfter Boromir died the Fellowship split into three paths. From there\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and\nPippin. Their plan was to take the hobbits to Saruman in Isengard. Along\nthe way the trio crossed through the Gap of Rohan and came across Éomer\nwho led the banished Riders of Rohan across the land. After questioning\nÉomer, they found out that the riders had already slain the Uruk-hai\nthey were meant to track, the night before in a bloody massacre. So upon\narriving to site of battle, Aragorn discovers that the hobbits fled deep\ninto Fangorn Forest.\n\nGandalf, though thought to be dead when he fell at the Bridge of Khazad\nDum in Moria, came back to Middle-earth, reincarnated as Gandalf the\nWhite. He encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Fangorn, and they,\nmistaking Gandalf for Saruman, attempted to kill him. Gandalf assured\nthem that Merry and Pippin were safe (knowing they were in the hands of\nTreebeard). From there they rode out to Edoras, capital of Rohan.

While attempting to take “the precious” in their sleep,\nFrodo and Sam awoke and captured him.

    "text": "The ROHIRRIM were a race of Men who inhabited the land of Rohan, which\nwas named after their famous horses.\n\nDescription and Culture\n\nThe Rohirrim were a tall, blonde, and mostly blue-eyed people. They were\nconservative and fiercely independent, remaining within their own\nlanguage and culture. Their horses were very important assets in their\neveryday lives, with their entire culture based around the breeding and\ntrading of them. They lived mostly in villages on the plains of Rohan\nwhere their horses grazed, and had few cities.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Rohirrim were descended from the Éothéod, a race who lived in the\nvales of the Great River Anduin but were removed to Calenardhon, a\nplains-land granted them in perpetuity by the Ruling Steward of Gondor,\nCirion, in reward for the assistance that they offered Gondor at a time\nof great need. As a result, they were lifelong allies of Gondor bound by\nthe Oath of Eorl. At that time Calenardhon was renamed Rohan\n(_Horse-land_) after their many horses. By the Rohirrim themselves Rohan\nis usually called “The Mark”.\n\nThe terms RIDERS OF ROHAN and RIDERS OF THE MARK are commonly used and\nrefer specifically to their mounted soldiers. The former is a chapter\ntitle in _The Two Towers_. The “King's Riders” were specifically the\nhorsemen who formed the king's bodyguard.\n\nThe Dunedain of Gondor believed that the Rohirrim were distantly related\nto them (having descended from the Atanatári of the First Age) and\ndescribe them as _Middle Men_, that being inferior to the Númenóreans in\nboth culture and descent, but superior to the _Men of Darkness_ who had\nworshiped and served Sauron.\n\nThe Rohirrim had contacts with Elves in their ancient history, and knew\nof Eru, but like the Dúnedain they did not worship him in any temples.\nThey seem to have highly valued the Vala Oromë the Hunter, whom they\ncalled _Béma_.\n\nThey are ruled by a line of kings descended from Eorl the Young, who had\nfirst brought them to Rohan, and in time of war every able man rode to\nmeet the Muster of Rohan.\n\nEtymology\n\n_Rohirrim_ is Sindarin for PEOPLE OF THE HORSE-LORDS (sometimes\ntranslated simply as HORSE-LORDS) and are mostly used by outsiders: the\nname they had for themselves are EORLINGAS, after their king Eorl the\nYoung who had first brought them to Rohan. _Rohirrim_ is a collective\nnoun, and when used grammatically as a subject or object is usually used\nwith the definite article (i.e. _the Rohirrim_). It can also be used as\nan adjective to modify another noun (e.g., a Rohirrim village, a troop\nof Rohirrim cavalry, etc.) The pure adjectival form, meaning “pertaining\nto the Rohirrim,” is _Rohirric_ (Rohirric tactics, Rohirric culture,\netc.)\n\nAnglo-Saxon Connection\n\nThe Rohirrim seem to resemble the ancient Anglo-Saxons, a Germanic\npeople comprising three tribes, the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes,\nwho invaded and conquered Britain around the 5th century. Tolkien was\nhimself a distinguished professor of the Anglo-Saxon language (Old\nEnglish).\n\nThe people of Rohan resemble the Anglo-Saxons in several ways. In\nappearance they are fair skinned and mostly blond haired, like the\nGermanic invaders, but they also have cultural links to those ancient\ntribes. This is shown in the type of armour used by Rohirric warriors,\nwhich includes an extensive choice of mail, both chain and scaled, and\nin their reverence for the sword as an expensive yet symbolically\nimportant weapon, to be given a title and passed down through\ngenerations.\n\nRohirric armies are also known to favour the shield-wall, which was a\nstrategy commonly employed by the Anglo-Saxons. Finally, common names\ngiven to the people of Rohan tend to resemble names of Old English. For\ninstance, the name Éomer is found in the Beowulf saga (an epic Tolkien\nbuilt much of his career around), and means “horse-famous” in Old\nEnglish. While these traits of the Rohirrim could be passed off as\ntypical of any agricultural, Northern society of Europe, such as the\nVikings, taken as a whole and with the knowledge that Tolkien was an\nacclaimed professor of Anglo-Saxon and indeed had set out to create a\nuniquely “English” mythology, it can be inferred that the descriptions\nof the Rohirrim were heavily drawn from those of the ancient\nAnglo-Saxons.\n\nHowever one aspect of the Rohirrim, their close affinity to horses as\nbeasts of warfare and their extensive and superb use of cavalry, is not\na trait that is shared with the ancient Anglo-Saxon tribes, who were\npredominately foot-soldiers in wartime. (It was, however, characteristic\nof the Ostrogoths, a Germanic tribe that dominated eastern Europe during\nthe late Roman period, whose language was also studied by Tolkien.)\nTolkien's choice to represent the Northern-descended Rohirrim as a\nhorse-loving people is in itself quite interesting, but is obviously\npart of his unique mythology. Yet it has been argued that one possible\nreason for the horse inclusion is the events of 1066 in England.\nAccording to Tom Shippey, Tolkien imagined the Rohirrim to be a\nhorse-culture because the only surviving Anglo-Saxon words for color\nwere all words for the colors of horses.\n\nAt this point the Anglo-Saxons were defeated by the invading Normans,\nwho were able to win the battle through their superior use of cavalry.\nTherefore, it has been stated that this inclusion may an idea influenced\nby this, that if the Anglo-Saxon had been horse-lords they could have\nwon the Battle of Hastings thus preserving the Anglo-Saxon culture which\nTolkien enjoyed. Certainly, whether the Rohirrim truly are partly or\nwholly based on the Anglo-Saxons can be a topic of debate among Tolkien\nfans and scholars.",

    "text": "The BLACK NÚMENÓREANS were a fallen group of Númenóreans who were\ndescended from those loyal to the Númenórean crown but opposed to the\nValar and relations with the Elves. They listened to the words of\nSauron. Soon they were corrupted by him, and would come to worship the\nDarkness and Morgoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSecond Age\n\nOrigins\n\nAs the power and knowledge of the Númenóreans grew throughout the course\nof the Second Age, they became increasingly preoccupied with the limits\nplaced on their contentment in the world - and eventually their power -\nby mortality, the purpose of which they began to question.\n\nAs time went on they began to fear death more and more and ultimately\nwished to escape it. So the Númenóreans became envious of the immortal\nElves (the Eldar), whom they had come to physically resemble as part of\ntheir reward from Ilúvatar for having been their allies. The Eldar\nsought ever to remind the Men of Numenor however, that death was a gift\nfrom Ilúvatar to all Men, and to lose faith in Ilúvatar would be\nheretical.\n\nNevertheless, after SA 2221, when Tar-Ancalimon became King of Numenor.\nThe 'King's Men' therefore became increasingly predisposed to the\ncorruption of Sauron after he came to Numenor.\n\nEventually, in Numenor's last years, its hugely powerful but elderly\nKing Ar-Pharazôn, who had become “frightened of old age” (_Letters_,\nno.156), was persuaded by Sauron that Ilúvatar was a lie invented by the\nValar, and seduced him. Within Numenor, the majority immediately\nfollowed suit, and this worship quickly passed across the ocean when\nthey sailed eastwards from Numenor, to most of Numenor's colonies in\nMiddle-earth where the group started in proper.\n\nThe group thrived in Middle-earth, particularly in Umbar after the\ndestruction of Numenor. They continued to oppose The Faithful, from\nwhich came the Kings of Arnor and Gondor, the Black Númenóreans remained\nloyal towards Sauron.\n\nThree of the Ringwraiths can be considered among the first and most\npowerful Númenóreans who were corrupted by Sauron, 1000 years before the\nDownfall: they served Sauron, being enslaved to his will, having become\nso because of their lust for power or knowledge.\n\nThese sacrilegious 'black arts' and 'follies', which arose as a\nconsequence of their worship of 'The Dark' and Melkor, marked the final,\nirrevocable division between the 'King's Men' and the minority known as\nthe 'Faithful' Númenóreans, or the 'Elendili', who kept to their old\nfaith in Ilúvatar. They were also presumably the earliest culture traits\nof those who became known afterwards as Black Númenóreans.\n\nAfter the Fall of Numenor\n\nFor many centuries after the Downfall, descendants of the 'King's Men'\nheld onto colonies in Middle-earth, what became the most northerly and\nfamous of their Realms in Exile, Umbar.\n\nMost of those few Númenóreans who had never disavowed the Eldar, and had\nalways remained true to their belief in Ilúvatar, also survived the\ndestruction of their homeland, and they established their own Realms in\nExile north of Umbar, in familiar and friendly colonies. The Faithful\nNúmenóreans saw their southern counterparts as renegades. The Black\nNúmenóreans held a similarly low opinion of 'The Faithful' and their\ndescendants.\n\nOnly two Black Númenórean lords are named from the time of the late\nSecond Age: Herumor and Fuinur. Like all Black Númenóreans and 'King's\nMen' before them, Herumor and Fuinur desired power over men of other,\n lesser races, and they “rose to (great)\npower amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring Umbar. Their fate\nis unknown, but they were likely defeated along with Sauron at the War\nof the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\n\nThird Age\n\nThe Black Númenórean style of rule was no doubt tyrannical, but may also\nhave involved a tradition of duumviracy, at least in Umbar, whose lords\nare usually paired when mentioned; Herumor/Fuinur for example, were\nprobably rulers of Umbar, as much later Angamaitë/Sangahyando were.\nWhatever political system was in place, however, the Black Númenóreans\ndid not govern effectively.\n\nThe triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black\nNúmenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. Nevertheless,\nthe Black Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a\nthousand years after Numenor's fall, maintaining much influence in\nHaradwaith. As late as Angamaitë for example, even after being exiled\nfrom their homeland for nearly a century.\n\nBlack Numenoreans in the 3rd age eventually joined The Witch King of\nAngmar in his conquests of Arnor. The fate of the Black Numenoreans of\nAngmar is unknown, but it's most likely they either all died or\ndisbanded after the Battle of Fornost.\n\nThe Black Númenóreans did not use Westron, but probably retained their\nold tongue Adûnaic, speaking a dialect of it. (In The Notion Club\nPapers, part of Sauron Defeated, Arundel Lowdham cited two descendants\nof classical Adûnaic. One of these must have been Westron, the other the\ntongue of the Black Númenóreans (Black Adûnaic?).\n\nThe Black Númenóreans are absent from recorded history after their\ndefeat by Ciryaher in TA 1050, but a  population of sorts must have survived somewhere at least\nuntil the end of the Third Age, as the Mouth of Sauron, who mocked the\narmy of King Elessar in front of the Black Gate was described both as a\nBlack Númenórean and “Renegade”, which is presumably the term used by\nthe Free Peoples of that time to describe all folk of similar ancestry.\n\nIn one of his letters, Tolkien wrote that Queen Berúthiel, wife of\nGondor's King Tarannon Falastur was a Black Númenórean, from a Black\nNúmenórean realm he describes as “the inland city” somewhere south of\nUmbar. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a political\naccommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies the\nexistence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans than\nthe much later Mouth of Sauron.",

    "text": "The SINDAR (meaning _Grey People_, singular _Sinda_, although the latter\nterm was not generally used) were Elves of Telerin descent. They are\nalso known as the GREY ELVES. They are a sub-group of the Eldar and a\nfurther sub-group of the Teleri. They are the Elves that chose to remain\nin Beleriand and not complete the Great Journey.\n\nSindar was the name given by the Noldorin exiles to those of the Teleri\nwho lived in Beleriand and did not complete the Great Journey. The\nSindar are called “grey” perhaps because they were not Elves of the\nLight, never having actually set foot in Valinor, but neither were they\nAvari, since they did accept the invitation and set out on the journey\n(and therefore were technically counted among the Eldar). They are\nsometimes referred to as ELVES OF THE TWILIGHT. The term _grey_ may also\nrefer to Elu Thingol's grey cloak. It may also be related to _Lindar_,\nthe Telerin name for themselves. The name that the Sindar used for\nthemselves was simply _EDHIL_ (“Elves”, singular _Edhel_).\n\nHistory\n\nThe Teleri were the greatest host of the Eldar. They had two kings, the\nbrothers Elwë Singollo (or Elu Thingol as he was later known in the\nSindarin tongue) and Olwë. When the Teleri reached Beleriand during the\nGreat Journey from Cuiviénen, Thingol went wandering in the forests. In\nthe forest of Nan Elmoth he met Melian, one of the Maiar. They fell in\nlove, and with Melian, Thingol stood spellbound in Nan Elmoth for\nseveral hundred years.\n\nIn the meantime, Olwë and many of the Teleri could not delay longer, and\nwent to Aman without Elwë and his following. Elwë's followers stayed in\nBeleriand, to search for their king. At long last, he awoke from the\nspell and set up a kingdom in the midst of Beleriand: Eglador (Land of\nthe Forsaken, or Land of the Elves). The Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost\nin the Blue Mountains were contracted to aid in the building of the city\nof Menegroth.\n\nOther Teleri also stayed behind: these were the friends of Ossë the\nMaia, who had fallen in love with the shores of Middle-earth, and did\nnot wish to depart. Their leader was Círdan, and they established cities\nat Eglarest and Brithombar. They were known as the Falathrim, or Elves\nof the Falas (Shore). They were not part of the realm of Eglador, but\nstill took Thingol as their High King.\n\nYet other stray bands of Teleri settled in Nevrast and Hithlum to the\nnorth of Eglador, although these did not form any realms. The Teleri of\nEglador, the northlands, and the Falas were also known as Sindar, in\nlater days, because they developed a civilisation all their own, which\nalmost equaled that of the Calaquendi.\n\nA last group of Teleri in Beleriand was the Laiquendi: they were\ndescended from the Nandor, who had split from the Great Journey before\nthe Hithaeglir, and gone south along the Great River Anduin. A part of\nthem, under Denethor, son of Lenwë, crossed the Blue Mountains, and\neventually settled in Ossiriand, or as it was later known: Lindon. They\nremained a people apart for long, although many of them removed to\nThingol's realm after Denethor was killed.\n\nThe friends of Elwë Singollo, who remained waiting for him while he was\nlost in Nan Elmoth, and the Falathrim, were persuaded to remain on the\nHither Shores by Ossë. Later the Laiquendi and the other Nandor who\nentered Beleriand were often counted among the Sindar. Although they\nwere Moriquendi Elves and thus never went to Aman, the Sindar achieved\ngreat wisdom during the Sleep of Yavanna, for they were guided by\nCírdan, Melian the Maia, and Elwë, who as Elu Thingol who had returned\nas a great overlord of Elves. Thingol's kingdom was to become the center\nof Sindarin power and culture. Many Sindar lived in Mithrim and the\nFalas, and some still wandered in the forests.\n\nThe Sindar were somewhat scorned but respected by the Ñoldorin exiles\nwho returned to Middle-earth to found great realms and wage war against\nthe Dark Lord Morgoth, and many Sindarin Elves considered them usurpers\nand to blame for Morgoth's return. The Sindar did not play a very active\noffensive role in the The Battles of Beleriand in the War of the Great\nJewels, although they did suffer heavily from the forces of Morgoth.\nTheir overall relationship with the Ñoldor was a somewhat contentious\none; the Ñoldor, for their part, held themselves in overall higher\nesteem than the Sindar, and were a bit contemptuous of the Sindar's\nrelative lack of will to fight Morgoth. The Sindar often saw their\ncousins as arrogant trespassers, and many also at least somewhat blamed\nthem for the return of Morgoth and all the misery it entailed. At the\nend of the First Age many Sindar went over the Great Sea, and throughout\nsucceeding ages, there was a steady migration of Sindar to the West.\nThose of the Sindar who remained in Middle-earth dwelt in Lindon or in\nElven-realms such as the Woodland Realm. In later ages the Sindar were\ncounted fully among the Eldar.\n\nThe Sindar were happy dwelling in Middle-earth, but once the desire for\nthe Sea was aroused in them, they could not be content until they sailed\nto Eldamar in the Far West. Although less learned and powerful than the\nCalaquendi and less interested in crafts than the Noldor, they were\nextremely gifted in music, and their voices were very fair.\n\nJust before the arrival of the Ñoldorin exiles, the Dark Lord Morgoth\nreturned to his old stronghold of Angband, and his activities increased.\nThingol had Melian use her magic to create a girdle of bewilderment\naround Eglador, so that nobody could enter without the king's\npermission. Ever after it was known as Doriath. After the return of\nMorgoth and the Ñoldor, Thingol remained High King of the Sindar and\nnominal Overlord of Beleriand, but the Ñoldor, though not openly\nopposing the claim, essentially ignored it, and answered only to the\nauthority of their own High King.\n\nSpoken Languages\n\nThe Sindar spoke Sindarin; they invented the Cirth. The language of the\nSindar diverged from common Telerin Elvish over the long ages they were\nsundered from their kin, and became known as Sindarin. By the time the\nÑoldor arrived in Beleriand, the languages had become mutually\nunintelligible, but the Ñoldor were quick to learn it. In the Second and\nThird Age, Sindarin became known as the Noble Tongue, and became the\nElvish tongue used in daily speech throughout Middle-earth (helped by\nthe decree of Thingol, who forbade the use of the Ñoldorin language in\nhis realm). It was also adopted for daily use by the Númenóreans, and\nremained somewhat in use in the Realms in Exile of Gondor and Arnor.\n\nSindarin eventually replaced Ñoldorin Quenya as the language used by the\nÑoldor in Beleriand, even in predominantly Ñoldorin settlements such as\nGondolin, although Quenya survived as a language of universal knowledge\nand ancient lore.\n\nHigh Kings of the Sindar\n\n1.

    "text": "THORIN AND COMPANY were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf,\nand the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941.\nTheir main purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely\nMountain from the Dragon Smaug.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin\nin Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost\nfamily inheritance. Remembering that he had once known an adventurous\nHobbit on his travels in The Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to\ntheir company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable\nto force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the\nsometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The\nsuperstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number,\nand as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a\nfourteenth to fill in to their party.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nFormation of Thorin and Company\n\nOn the April 26, 2941, Gandalf and the Dwarves arrived at Bag End. After\nbig tea and supper with Bilbo, they explained themselves and their\nintentions. Bilbo was at first reluctant to join the group but Gandalf\nrushed him out of the door.\n\nTravels and Encounters\n\nAfter traveling for some time and crossing the river Hoarwell, the\ncompany were caught and nearly killed and eaten by three hungry trolls.\nGandalf returned in time to keep the monsters occupied until dawn, when\nthe light of the Sun turned them to stone. Recovering themselves, the\nDwarves found that these Trolls had a cave nearby filled with stolen\nweapons, food, and a small treasure. Amongst the many weapons were Sting\n(which Bilbo armed himself with, and which he named after a battle with\na giant spider), Orcrist (claimed by Thorin), and Glamdring (taken by\nGandalf). Strangely, all were ancient Elvish blades that had been forged\nseveral millennia earlier, in the First Age, in Gondolin.\n\n\n\nReaching Rivendell in June, the company held talks with Elrond and\nlearned about the secret Moon-letters on Thorin’s old map of the Lonely\nMountain. Elrond also read the runes on Orcrist and Glamdring, thus\nidentifying them. After spending a short time there, the group resumed\ntheir journey through the Misty Mountains.\n\nOn their way through the High Pass, the company (minus Gandalf) were\ncaptured by goblins. Taken before the Great Goblin, they were in mortal\ndanger. Gandalf suddenly appeared and killed the Great Goblin, creating\nenough disarray for them to escape. Unfortunately, Bilbo fell down a\nhole and was left behind during their hasty retreat. Wandering lost and\nalone in the depths of the mountain, he found the One Ring and met\nGollum, described in _The Hobbit_ as “a small slimy creature … as dark\nas darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face.”\n\nAfter a hazardous game of Riddles with the creature, Bilbo fortuitously\ndiscovered the ring he had found could make him invisible. Wearing the\nring, Bilbo escaped Gollum and a group of goblins guarding the eastern\ndoor out of the caverns, and soon reunited with his companions.\nCollecting themselves, the company made their way down the mountainside,\nwhere they were attacked by Wargs and forced to seek refuge in the\ntrees. Goblins soon arrived and tried to kill the company by getting\nthem down on the ground by tampering down the trees. With all hope\nnearly gone, the hapless company were rescued by a group of giant\nEagles.\n\nAfter thanking the Eagles, Thorin and Company made for Beorn's house\nwhere they managed to impress the wary shape-changer. Fully stocked and\nprepared the Company, they left Beorn's home and made for Mirkwood. When\nthey reached the edge of the perilous wood, Gandalf announced that he\nhad pressing business elsewhere and would not be coming with them\nthrough the forest. Grumbling, they went on ahead, taking the Forest\nPath into the darkness of Mirkwood. After a few days they reached a dark\nstream which Beorn had warned them not to drink or bathe in, for it was\nenchanted and caused great drowsiness and forgetfulness. They were able\nto cross it, but Bombur fell in. By the time they fished him out he was\nalready asleep and had to be carried by the rest of the company.\n\nEventually they reached a point where they were practically out of food\nand tried to beg from a group of feasting Wood-elves. Thorin was\ncaptured by these Elves, while the remaining company, with the exception\nof Bilbo, were snared by Giant Spiders. Bilbo rescued them with the help\nof his magic ring, but they were soon captured by the angry Elves and\nimprisoned by their king.\n\nWith the aid of the ring, Bilbo eluded the Dwarves' captors. Weeks\nlater, he found a way to free them. Hiding in empty wine barrels, the\ncompany made their way down the river to Lake-town. There they were fed\nand clothed with the hope that they would defeat Smaug and regain\nprosperity for the region.\n\nThey reached the mountain after a few days and tried to locate the\nSecret door described on the map. They found it with the help of a\nThrush. Thorin decided to have Bilbo enter the mountain and “burgle”\nsomething. This the hobbit did, and even had a conversation with the\nmighty Smaug (while wearing the Ring, so that he could not be seen). But\nthe enraged Dragon soon emerged and attacked Lake-town, leaving Thorin\nand Company free to enter the mountain. Meanwhile the dragon was slain\nby Bard of Lake-town, but the town suffered great loss and destruction.\nThe Dwarves remained inside the mountain until an army of Lake-men, and\nlater Wood-elves, led by the Elven-king, arrived seeking a share of the\ntreasure to compensate them for their losses. Thorin refused, and the\nDwarves were besieged within the mountain. They called for aid from\ntheir kin in the Iron Hills (a range to the east of The Lonely\nMountain).\n\nThe Battle of Five Armies and the Dissolving of the Company\n\n\n\nJust before they were about to fight the Elves, the company were joined\nby an army of Dwarves from the Iron Hills. Then Gandalf arrived, just in\ntime to inform them that an army of goblins and Wargs were coming to\nattack. The battle began and Thorin and Company went to war. Bilbo\nstayed out of the battle with the aid of the Ring. The enemy had the\nupper hand until the arrival of the eagles and Beorn. The company and\ntheir allies won but Fíli and Kíli had been killed and Thorin was\nmortally wounded. Bilbo bade farewell to Thorin as he lay dying, and\nthen left with Gandalf and a modest share of the treasure.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe deeds of Thorin and Company led to the restoration of the Dwarven\nKingdom of the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarven dynasty in the Lonely\nMountain, the Kingdom of Dale, the rebuilding of Lake-town, and\nrestoration of peace and prosperity in the immediate area for many\nyears. In the long term, the journey of Thorin and Company and the\nsituations it created led to the Council of Elrond and the formation of\nthe Fellowship of the Ring many years later and played a major part in\nthe starting of The War of the Ring.\n\nIt also depleted the forces of evil so that later Sauron would have less\nto call upon during the War of the Ring. Gloin's son, Gimli, would later\nbe a member of the Fellowship as well, contributing his axe to their\nultimate victory.

    "text": "EASTERLINGS, known in early times as SWARTHY MEN, were a race of Men who\nlived in the vast and uncharted lands of Rhûn, east of Mordor and the\nSea of Rhûn. Easterlings were enemies of the Free Peoples and were\nallies of Sauron. There were many different nations and kingdoms of\nEasterlings living in the vast lands of Rhûn. These ranged from\ncivilized empires to barbaric horse nomads of the open steppes.\n\nDescription\n\nEasterlings, being of many different races and people, were either tall\nand sallow-skinned or short and swarthy. However, there were also said\nto be a different type of Easterlings that appeared during the Siege of\nGondor from unknown eastern lands, who were broad, short, and\nbearded, and wielded axes like Dwarves. Easterlings were the most\nnumerous and deadly of the enemies of the Free Peoples, and it is said\nif the Blue Wizards had not been sent into Rhûn the hosts of the East\nwould have outnumbered the Western peoples. Their skin was either sallow\n(a pale yellow) or olive. Their eyes were dark (dark brown and black),\nand their straight hair was black. The “swarthier” Easterlings of the\nFirst Age and the Fourth Ages were not a related people, as those of the\nFirst came from the then-unknown lands east of the Blue Mountains, and\ncould have had more relation to the Dunlendings than the later Balchoth\nand Wainriders.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst Age\n\nDuring the First Age, the term was applied to the sons of Bór and\nUlfang, or the _Swarthy Men_, who came into Beleriand much later than\nthe Edain, and who were for a part secretly in league with Morgoth. By\nsome men of Dor-lómin that appear in the Wanderings of Hurin, they are\ncalled EASTRONS.\n\nBór was a leader of Men who came into Lothlann, in Beleriand, during the\nFA 463. His sons were Borlach, Borlad, and Borthand. Bór was welcomed by\nMaedhros, who gave him and his followers land north and south of the\nMarch of Maedhros. Bór and his sons swore allegiance to Maedhros, and\nremained faithful, though he was told by Morgoth to betray the banner of\nCaranthir. All of them were wiped out during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nUlfang also came in Lothlann, Beleriand, in 463, shortly after Bór. He\nwas the father of Ulfast, Ulwarth, and Uldor “the Accursed”. Ulfang was\nwelcomed by the sons of Fëanor, and he and his sons swore allegiance to\nCaranthir. They were given lands to dwell in the north and south of the\nMarch of Maedhros. Ulfang and his sons were secretly in the employ of\nMorgoth, and betrayed the Eldar and Edain during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad\nin what is now known as the Treachery of Men.\n\nRule in Hithlum\n\nAfter Nirnaeth Arnoediad at the bidding of Morgoth, the Easterlings\ninvaded Hithlum. They spread throughout the wide lands plundering,\ndestroying, and killing its inhabitants. The Eldar of Hithlum were able\nto escape from the invaders by taking refuge in the southern mountains\nthat later the Easterlings avoided out of fear of the Elves. The\nEasterlings soon withdrew northwards and apparently settled.\n\nHowever, the Easterlings were betrayed by their lord Morgoth, and locked\nsolely in Hithlum and denied the rich lands of the Beleriand that they\nso desired. Here the Easterlings governed with cruelty, robbing,\nstealing, and enslaving the remaining Men of Hithlum, who called the\nEasterlings the \" Incomers\". They took away the young and the able\nbodied and sometimes young women to be wives; the most widely known\nbeing Aerin of whom Brodda took to produce his heir. Despite these evil\ndeeds, they did not take Morwen nor her house from her for they feared\nher and believed her to be a witch and so her son had time to escape to\nDoriath. Tuor, the cousin of Túrin was also enslaved in Hithlum by the\nEasterlings but he was able to escape and evaded them by living as an\noutlaw, until he was contacted by the Vala Ulmo and went to Gondolin.\n\nThe Easterlings ruled effectively in Hithlum as vassals of Morgoth from\nFA 473 to FA 583. After the War of Wrath, those that survived fled back\nover the Blue Mountains to Eriador and beyond where they sat themselves\nup as kings and chieftains of many of the Middle Men.\n\nSecond Age\n\nA King of the Easterlings, Khamûl, was given one of the Rings of Power\nand became a powerful sorcerer, until the power of the Ring corrupted\nhim. Around SA 2251, Khamûl became a Wraith and one of Sauron's\nservants.\n\nThird Age\n\nDuring the Third Age, the term was applied to the various nations and\ntribes of Men living in the uncharted lands east of the Sea of Rhûn and\nMordor who were usually allied with Sauron (for one of their leaders was\nthe second greatest of the Nazgûl, Khamûl) and frequently attacked\nGondor and the lands bordering Rhûn. However, Sauron's defeat at the end\nof the War of the Last Alliance diminished his presence for over one\nthousand years, and any territorial ambition was left to them alone. In\nTA 490 they invaded Gondor, passing through Dagorlad and starting a\nseries of wars that lasted sixty years until they were finally defeated\nin TA 550 by Turambar, the ninth King of Gondor. Afterwards, Gondor\nsubdued some of them and took from them a large area of land between the\nKingdom of Rhovanion and Mordor including the Sea of Rhûn.\n\nGondor held on to these territories for a few hundred years but slowly\nbegan to lose them over time, and the Easterlings once again initiated\nwarfare. In TA 1248 they once again clashed with Gondor in a series of\nskirmishes but were still not powerful or organized enough to stand\nagainst Gondor’s power. Though defeated the Easterlings would not have\nto wait long, for Gondor soon fell into decline and civil war.\nAfterwards, the Easterling tribes remained peaceful for the most part\nuntil the mid-nineteenth century when they were again powerful enough to\nattack the west.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\nDuring the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age, the Easterlings\njoined with the forces of Mordor participating in the Northern battles\nthat nearly defeated the Elves of Mirkwood, Men of Dale, and the Dwarves\nof the Lonely Mountain.\n\nDespite being on the losing side in the war, some Easterlings still\ncontinued to remain a threat throughout the early Fourth Age but were\nfinally subdued in a series of campaigns led by King Elessar. In these\nbattles the Easterlings, aside from the hordes of Orcs, were the most\nnumerous and tenacious of Sauron's warriors.\n\nSpecific groups\n\nWainriders\n\nThe Wainriders were a confederation of Easterling and Haradrim tribes\nwho were united by their hate of Gondor, fueled by the Dark Lord Sauron.\nFollowing the Great Plague which weakened Gondor, they started their\nattacks in TA 1856, defeating a Gondor army at the Battle of the Plains\nand killing King Narmacil II. They rode in great chariots (which gave\nthem their name), and raided the lands of Rhovanion, destroying or\nenslaving its people. Gondor gradually lost all of its possessions east\nof Anduin to them.\n\nIn TA 1899, the thirtieth King of Gondor, Calimehtar son of Narmacil,\ndefeated the Wainriders at Dagorlad, buying some rest for his land.\nHowever the Wainriders struck back in TA 1944, allying themselves with\nthe Haradrim of Near Harad and the Variags of Khand. Before this they\nhad been expanding their power southward, beyond Mordor, and had come\ninto conflict with the tribes of Khand and the eastern Haradrim. But\neventually these men allied under their universal hate of the West. They\nmanaged to kill King Ondoher and all his heirs, but instead of riding on\nto Minas Anor and taking the city, they paused to celebrate.\n\nMeanwhile, general Eärnil of Gondor's southern army rode north to defend\nhis king defeating an inferior force of Haradrim in South Ithilien, he\ncame too late to rescue Ondoher, but he did manage to annihilate the\nWainriders for good at the Battle of the Camp. Eärnil was crowned king.\nAfter this defeat the might of the Wainriders was broken, and they\nretreated east. They still held Rhovanion, but never troubled Gondor\nagain until the War of the Ring.\n\nBalchoth\n\nThe Balchoth were a fierce race of Easterlings, who attacked Gondor\nwhile under orders of Dol Guldur. In TA 2510, they overran the plains of\nCalenardhon and almost destroyed the army of the Ruling Steward Cirion,\nbut were defeated by the Éothéod under Eorl the Young. Like the\nWainriders they rode in chariots and wagons, and they may have been\ndescendants of these people. However, they were notably far more\nprimitive and savage than the advanced Wainriders, so their origin is at\nmost obscure.\n\nWeapons\n\nNot much is known about the weapons used by the Easterlings. They had as\nfar as it is known among their arsenal spears, bows, axes and chariots.\nThey also seemed to favor the horse on many occasions, although all this\nprobably differed greatly among the Easterling tribes, kingdoms, or\nempires.\n\nCulture\n\nKnowledge of the culture of the Easterlings is limited. In the First Age\nthey could be quite savage; examples of this rise from Brodda's\ntreatment of the Men of the House of Hador in Dor-lómin. In the Third\nAge at least, the Easterlings fought with great valor, as displayed\nduring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the Battle of the Black\nGate. The numerous clans of the Easterlings were united by Emperors and\nKings of Rhûn (like Khamûl). An Emperor of the Easterlings was supposed\nto have led an army to the Battle of Dale and supported Sauron.",

    "text": "DURIN'S FOLK (also called the LONGBEARDS) were a clan of Dwarves\n\n   that originally inhabited Moria in the Misty Mountains, led by Durin\n   I, “The Deathless”. He was succeeded by many generations of kings,\n   among them appeared six others also called Durin. (The Dwarves\n   believed that these six were the reincarnation of Durin I, with\n   memories of their past lives.)\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Second Age, Durin's Folk began a friendship with the Noldor\nof Celebrimbor in Eregion.\n\nIn the middle of the Third Age, they were expelled by the Balrog of\nMoria known as the “Durin's Bane”. In TA 1980 their king Durin VI was\nkilled by the creature that the following year also killed his son Náin\nI. Thráin I, Nain's son, fled along with his people to the Lonely\nMountain where he founded the Kingdom of the Lonely Mountain. During the\nreign of Thorin I son of Thrain was heard rumors greater wealth in the\nGrey Mountains. Thorin decided to leave Erebor and take his people to\nthe north, where they lived in peace until the reign of his grandson\nNain II when they began to be attacked by dragons. During the reign of\nDáin I, one Cold-drake invaded his kingdom and killed him along with his\nsecond child, Frór. Thrór, eldest son of Dain I, and now King of Durin's\nFolk, returned along with his uncle Borin and part of his people to the\nLonely Mountain. His younger brother Grór left for the east where he\nfounded his kingdom in the Iron Hills. Thrór ruled during long years of\npeace until a Fire Drake, Smaug, the last of the great dragons,\ndescended from the north and sacked and took the Lonely Mountain.\nDurin's Folk became a nomadic people in exile. Many of them went to the\nIron Hills and settled there. Thrór went insane, and tried to reclaim\nKhazad-dûm by himself, leading to his death at the hand of Azog.\n\nThis started the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which ended at the Battle\nof Azanulbizar, where Azog was killed by Dáin Ironfoot, lord of the Iron\nHills. After the battle, many of the Dwarves under the rule of Thrain II\nwent to the west to the Blue Mountains and settled there. After 60 years\nThrain's son, Thorin II, or “Thorin Oakenshield”, was convinced by the\nwizard Gandalf to lead a company of 13 Dwarves and one Hobbit on a quest\nto recover the Lonely Mountain. The quest lead to the death of Smaug at\nthe hand of Bard the Bowman, and the great Battle of Five Armies against\narmies of Orcs, in which Thorin and his nephews Fili and Kili were\nkilled. But Thorin's sacrifice led to the Kingdom of the Lonely Mountain\nbeing restored under the rule of his cousin Dáin II, Lord of the Iron\nHills, who became King under the Mountain in TA 2941. He died in the\nbattle of Dale at the end of the Third Age, fighting hordes of\nEasterlings in Dale. His people were then besieged. After Sauron was\ndefeated, his son Thorin III Stonehelm and Bard II, the new king of\nDale, defeated the Easterlings.\n\nDurin VII, the last to be named “Durin”, later retook Moria and became\nknown as “Durin the Last”.\n\nKings of Durin's Folk\n\nHere is a full account of all the Kings of Durin's Line, but the\nfollowing list shows only the names of those Kings who were saved or\nwhose reigns can be studied. As the descendants of Durin I were forced\nby circumstances to travel through Middle-earth, the main sites of their\nmonarchy is shown along with the name of each king.\n\nDurin I, Khazad-dum\n\nDurin the Deathless was the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves,\ncreated by Aulë during the First Age of the World. He was called “the\nDeathless” as he lived long before an age far more advanced than any\nother Dwarf, and so was revered as the eldest of their race.\n\nEach of these seven Dwarves' parents founded a house. Durin's House was\nthe Longbeards, and his people were named Durin's Folk.\n\nAccording to the traditions of the Dwarves, he was put to sleep alone\nunder Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains, which remained\na sacred site for them. He awoke some time after the awakening of the\nElves in 1050 the Age of the Trees, and according to ancient legends he\ntraveled long distances to find other families of Dwarves, and then\nother Dwarves followed. He came to the Mirrormere, a lake in a valley\nbelow Caradhras in the Misty Mountains, and there founded what would\nbecome the largest and richest of the Mansions of the Dwarves:\nKhazad-dûm, also known as Moria .\n\nIn the published version of the story, Durin died before the end of the\nFirst Age. In an old version of Appendix B (“The Tale of Years”) he\nappears leading the Dwarves of the ruined kingdoms of Beleriand to found\nKhazad-dûm at the beginning of the Second Age, but Tolkien abandoned\nthis idea.\n\nAfter the death of Durin, Khazad-dûm was ruled by generations of his\ndescendants until the Balrog, Durin's Bane appeared. In this long line,\nTolkien writes, “Appearing occasionally was an heir like his ancestor\nwho was called Durin”. More complete versions of the Durin's Folk make\nclear that Durins appeared spaced among many generations.\n\nDurin II, Khazad-dûm\n\nTolkien did not write anything about his reign. There are indications\nthat the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm reached an agreement with the first Men\nof the Vales of Anduin, who provided them food in exchange for weapons\nmade by the Dwarves. Such cooperation has evolved into coordinated\nattacks against the Orcs with the heavy infantry of the Dwarves\ncomplemented by mounted archers of the valleys.\n\nDurin III, Khazad-dûm\n\nRuled around 1600 Second Age. And was the first Dwarf-Lord given one of\nthe Seven Rings, although it was not widely known until the end of the\nThird Age. The Dwarves believe that he received this ring from\nCelembrimbor and not from Sauron, even with this having participated in\nthe forging.\n\nHammond and Scull conclude that Durin III was most likely King of\nKhazad-dûm when the West Gate of Moria was built, thus is the Durin\nwhose name appears on the door that was made when the Dwarves were\nallies of Celebrimbor. This is a reasonable reference but appears to be\nunfounded by some direct evidence from Tolkien's writings.\n\nDurin IV, Khazad-dûm\n\nTolkien did not write anything about his reign. He would have lived in\nKhazad-dûm at the end of the Second Age or the beginning of the Third\nAge.\n\nDurin V, Khazad-dûm (Third Age ? - Third Age ?)\n\nDurin V lived in Khazad-dûm, and with the aid of the Dwarf-ring\nprospered. He was the last of the Durins to have reigned in peace as\nKing of Khazad-dûm without knowledge of the Balrog that slept beneath\nthem.\n\nDurin VI, Khazad-dûm (reigned until TA 1980)\n\nDurin VI was King of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm in the Third Age, when\nDwarves mining in search of mithril in Caradhras' roots awakened the\nBalrog of hiding deep within the earth. The creature killed Durin TA\n1980, and became known as “Durin's Bane”. Durin VI was the first known\nreincarnation of Durin the Deathless to not have a natural death. He was\nsucceeded by his son, Náin I, who was killed by the same Balrog in the\nfollowing year and after this tragic event the ancient city was\nabandoned by its people.\n\nNáin I, son of Durin VI. Khazad-dûm\n\nHe ruled for only one year in Khazad-dûm before being killed by the\nBalrog. He was the last of the Kings of Durin's Line to rule in\nKhazad-dûm, being replaced by his son as King-in-exile.\n\nThráin I, son of Náin I: Erebor. (ruled for 209 years, until TA 2190)\n\nThráin I led a large part of his people away from Khazad-dûm to the\nNortheast of Middle-earth. It was Thráin who founded the great Kingdom\nof the Lonely Mountain in TA 1999, under The Lonely Mountain near the\ncity of Dale and Lake-town on the Long Lake. He was succeeded by his\nson.\n\nThorin I, son of Thrain I. Grey Mountains\n\nHearing of greater riches in the Grey Mountains, he decided to leave\nthe Lonely Mountain with the greater part of his folk, along with the\nDwarven treasure: The Arkenstone, leaving the mountain abandoned for\nover three-hundred years until his descendent Thrór reclaimed it. He was\nsucceeded as king by his son Glóin.\n\nGlóin the son of Thorin I. Grey Mountains (reigned for 96 years until TA\n2385)\n\nGlóin continued the reign of his father in the Grey Mountains, and was\nsucceeded by his son.\n\nÓin, son of Gloin. Grey Mountains (He ruled for 103 years until 2488 TA)\n\nDuring his reign, the Dwarves of Durin's Folk still lived in the Grey\nMountains to the north. In the last years of his reign, the Shadow\nreturned to Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and Orcs and other evil creatures\nbegan to multiply in the northern mountains, and in the later years of\nÓin, the orcs invaded Moria, which was abandoned, and took it. This was\nonly the first of the calamities that would fall on the Durin home for\ncenturies to come.\n\nÓin was 250 years old when he died, having reigned for 103 years. He was\nsucceeded by his son, Náin, who became King Náin II.\n\nNáin II, son of Óin. Grey Mountains (reigned for 97 years until 2585 TE)\n\nAt that time, the prosperous Dwarves began to suffer an attack from the\nnorth by dragons, Náin had two sons, the oldest Dáin, and Borin. he was\nsucceeded by his eldest son as was custom.\n\nDáin I, II Náin son. Grey Mountains (reigned for four years until 2589\nTE)\n\nDáin I's short reign had a blunt end when he was killed next to his\nsecond child, Fror, by a great Cold-drake at the door of his own\nkingdom. He was succeeded by the eldest of his three sons.\n\nThrór the son of Dáin I. Erebor (He ruled for 201 years until 2790 TE)\n\nHe led his people out of the north, infested with dragons, back to the\nLonely Mountain, while his younger brother, Grór, took a piece of his\npeople further east, to dwell in the Iron Hills. He was King under the\nMountain for more than 180 years, until the great dragon Smaug descended\nupon the kingdom and sacked The Lonely Mountain. He escaped destruction\nwith his son and grandson, and wandered the wilderness. He went mad, and\ntried to single-handedly reclaim the former home of his people,\nKhazad-dûm, which he found infested with Orcs. His death at the hands of\nAzog, leader of the Orcs, was the trigger for the War of the Dwarves and\nOrcs. He was succeeded by his son, Thrain II .\n\nThrain II, son of Thrór, King in Exile. Dunland, later the Blue\nMountains (reigned for 60 years until 2850 TA)\n\nThrain II avenged the death of his father by defeating Azog and his army\nof Orcs in Azanulbizar. In the first half of his life, he lived on\nErebor, but later moved to the Blue Mountains west of Eriador. Before\nhis reign ended, he decided to return to Erebor, but while traveling\nthrough the forest, he was captured by evil creatures and died in the\ndungeons of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur. He was succeeded by his son.\n\nThorin II, or Thorin Oakenshield, son of Thrain II. Blue Mountains\n(reigned for 91 years until 2941 TA)\n\nThorin II was a ruler of the Blue Mountains for many years but, like\n\nhis father, was determined to return to his former home in Erebor.\nAccompanied by Gandalf, twelve other Dwarves, and Bilbo Baggins, he\njourneyed far to the East and, against all expectations, recovered the\nLonely Mountain from Smaug. After the death of Smaug, the Battle of Five\nArmies was fought at the feet of Erebor, and Thorin was killed. The only\nliving descendants of Thrór's lineage, his young nephews Fili and Kili,\nhad also perished in battle and so the monarchy was passed to the line\nof Grór, younger brother of Thrór, specifically for Grór's grandson,\nDáin Ironfoot. Although he was not crowned King under the Mountain,\nThorin had claimed the title by law, once he had recovered Erebor.\n\nDáin II, or Dáin Ironfoot, Grór grandson. Erebor (reigned for 78 years\nuntil 3019 T. E.)\n\nDáin succeeded his father, Nain, as Lord of the Iron Hills. Became King\nunder the Mountain as well as King of all the Durin's Folk after the\ndeath of his cousin Thorin Oakenshield, the first in Durin's lineage to\ninherit the kingdom without being the father-to-son succession. Reigned\nsuccessfully for many years until the time of the War of the Ring when\nhe was killed in the Battle of Dale, despite his great age valiantly\nfighting the Easterlings who, under Sauron's orders, attacked Erebor and\nDale. After his death the Men and Dwarves were besieged inside Erebor.\nHe was succeeded by his son.\n\nThorin III, or Thorin Stonehelm. Erebor\n\nThorin III took the lead of his people after the death of his father. He\nendured a brief siege of seven days in Erebor, when news of the defeat\nof Sauron reached the Easterlings, he and the Men of Dale led by Bard II\ncharged out of the mountain and routed the Easterlings. He helped\nrebuild the Lonely Mountain and Dale, and prospered. His realm became a\nclose ally of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor of King Elessar.\nThorin III had an heir, who was held to be the reincarnation of Durin\nthe Deathless, and who succeeded him at his death as Durin VII the Last.\n\nDurin VII\n\nDurin VII, or “the Last”, was a direct descendant of King Thorin\nStonehelm (and according to some sources, was his son), ruler of Erebor\nand the Iron Hills in the Fourth Age. His birth was apparently\nprophesied at the rise of Dáin II after the Battle of Five Armies. He\nled the Dwarves of Durin's Folk in the recolonization of Khazad-dum some\ntime after the beginning of the Fourth Age, and there they remained\n“Until the world grew old and the days of Durin's race came to an end.”\n\nDurin I died before the end of the First Age, then between his reign and\nThorin III, Kings of Durin's Line ruled for a period of about 6,500\nyears. Assuming that the average time of a reign of a King of Durin's\nFolk was approximately a century, it can be deduced that there have been\nabout fifty names of Kings that are not on this list.",

He gave nine of them to nine\nkings of Men, three of which were Numenoreans and one was an Easterling.\nSauron meant to and succeeded in his goal of corrupting the powerful\nNine.

Their lives and power became\nbound to Sauron's via the One Ring; as Sauron grew or diminished in\npower, so too did the Nazgûl.\n\nThree of the Ringwraiths can be considered among the first and most\npowerful Numenoreans who were corrupted by Sauron, 1000 years before the\nDownfall: they served Sauron, being enslaved to his will, having become\nso because of their lust for power or knowledge.\n\nOnly two of the Nine were ever named: the Witch-king of Angmar\nand Khamûl the Easterling.\n\nThe Nine were first seen around 2251 of the Second Age, and soon became\nSauron's primary servants. Despite being his most useful servants, not\nmuch is known of their activities during the Second Age. They were\ntemporarily dispersed after Sauron's downfall in SA 3434 during the war\nof Last Alliance of Elves and Men, losing the ability to maintain any\nsort of physical form as Sauron did after losing the One Ring. However,\nthe Ring was not destroyed, and as such, both the Nazgûl and Sauron were\nable to endure.\n\nReturn of the Nazgûl\n\nThe Nazgûl re-emerged around 1301 of the Third Age as Sauron at long\nlast began to take shape after his defeat at the hands of the Last\nAlliance. It was around this time that the Witch-king established\nhimself in Angmar and began to launch attacks against the nearby kingdom\nof Arnor, which had fractured into three smaller kingdoms due to\ninfighting. His first target was the realm of Rhudaur. After conquering\nRhudaur and replacing the Dunedain king with one of the native Hillmen\nin the year TA 1356 the Witch-king moved against Arthedain, resulting in\nthe death of King Argeleb I.\n\nBut Arthedain was not yet defeated, and it managed to maintain a line of\ndefense along the Weather Hills. In TA 1409 came the attack on Cardolan.\nAlso during this time, the forces of the Witch-king burned and destroyed\nthe watchtower of Amon Sûl. After the fall of Cardolan, Angmar's advance\nwas slowed by resistance from the elves of Lindon and Rivendell. By TA\n1974, Angmar arose again and captured Arthedain's capital of Fornost,\nand with that, the last kingdom of Arnor was destroyed.\n\nA year later, a prince of Gondor named Eärnur arrived with the intention\nof aiding Arthedain.\n\n[The Nazgûl Witch-king with his helm]\n\nHowever, Eärnur arrived too late to be of help in defending any of\nArnor's territories. Instead, he and his army sought revenge against the\nWitch-king. He and his forces marched against the armies of the\nWitch-king and utterly destroyed them during the Battle of Fornost. With\nthe destruction of his forces, the Witch-king escaped and retreated to\nMordor. Despite the complete annihilation of Angmar, the campaign was\naccounted a tremendous success by Sauron, for the territories formerly\noccupied by Arnor became essentially wilderness, with the Dunedain\nRangers being all that stood between its people and complete\nlawlessness. At some point, the Barrow-wights left Angmar and Rhudaur to\noccupy the Barrow-downs of Cardolan. Upon his return to Mordor, the\nWitch-king gathered the other eight Nazgûl. In the year TA 2000 the\nNazgûl attacked, and after two years conquered Minas Ithil (which was\nrenamed Minas Morgul), acquiring a Palantír for the Dark Lord.\n\nIt was from Minas Morgul that the Nine directed the rebuilding of\nSauron's armies and the preparation of Mordor for their master's return.\nIn 2942 Sauron returned to Mordor, openly declaring himself by TA 2951.\nHe sent three of the Nazgûl to garrison his fortress Dol Guldur in\nMirkwood. They were led by Khamûl, the second most powerful of the\nNazgûl behind the Witch-King.\n\nHunt for the Ring\n\nShire and Bree\n\n[The Nine leaving Minas Morgul]\n\nNear the beginning of the War of the Ring in TA 3018, Gollum, a Stoor\nwho had once owned the One Ring, was captured and tortured in Mordor.\nFrom him, Sauron learned of the location of the One, and the family\nidentity of those who had kept it. Having learned this, Sauron released\nGollum, but Gollum was soon recaptured by Aragorn, captain of the\nRangers of the North. Learning of this, Gandalf the Grey went\nimmediately to interrogate the creature and discovered that Sauron now\nknew where the Ring was and who had it; the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.\nAccordingly, Gandalf advised Frodo to leave the Shire and make for\nRivendell, taking the Ring with him. However, Sauron wasted no time in\nattempting to capture the Ring, sending all of the Nine to retrieve it.\n\nSoon the Nazgûl entered the Shire, where they learned the Ring was in\npossession of Bilbo Baggins' nephew, Frodo Baggins. After searching for\nFrodo, one of the Nine, Khamûl the Easterling, had his first encounter\nwith him.\n\nAs Frodo and his friends, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, took Bucklebury ferry\nto reach Crickhollow, Khamûl, who had narrowly missed them, was forced\nto go around to the Brandywine Bridge instead. Shortly after this, the\nNine arrived at Frodo's new home in Crickhollow.\n\nThough Frodo had already left for Bree by the time the Nine arrived,\nthey were soon given information regarding Frodo's whereabouts by Bill\nFerny, a spy of Saruman. Consequently, the Nazgûl attacked the village\nof Bree, where Frodo was located. However, during the time it took the\nNazgûl to reach Bree, Frodo and company, fortunately, encountered\nAragorn himself, who had been asked by Gandalf to watch for the hobbits\nand aid them if he could.\n\nWeathertop\n\n[Five Nazgûl confronting the four Hobbits at Weathertop] Unable to find\nthe Hobbit, the Nine left Bree, and at Weathertop several days later\nthey encountered Gandalf the Grey, who was scouting nearby on his way to\nRivendell to meet up with Frodo. An all-night battle commenced at\nWeathertop between the Nazgûl and Gandalf. Though Gandalf was able to\nescape, four of the Nine pursued him, while five remained near\nWeathertop. Several days later, Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry\nmade camp at the base of the ruins of Amon Sûl.\n\nDiscovering them, the five Nazgûl attacked the group. As they confronted\nthe four Hobbits, Frodo put on the Ring and attempted to resist the\nNazgûl. The Nazgûl leader quickly stabbed Frodo with a Morgul-blade, but\nthe Nazgûl then fled because Aragorn arrived carrying firebrands,\n\nThe Ford of Bruinen\n\n[The Nine crossing the fords of Bruinen]\n\nThe Hobbits and Aragorn kept on to Rivendell Aragorn carrying Frodo for\nhe had been stabbed with a Morgul Blade and was passing into the shadow\nrealm, Arwen Daughter of Elrond Half-Elven caught up to them on\nhorseback she took Frodo onto her horse and with great speed went on to\nRivendell. Regrouping, the Nazgûl continued to pursue Frodo. Eventually,\nthey caught up with him, then riding the horse of Glorfindel. Chasing\nFrodo until they reached the Ford of Bruinen, the nine Nazgûl, now\nreunited, demanded Frodo give them the Ring. Frodo refused and defied\nthem. Provoked, the Nazgûl crossed the river to take the Ring by force\nfrom a weak and injured Frodo. However, Arwen spoke in elvish to the\nwater and the water, enchanted by Elrond and Gandalf, formed a great\nwave and swept the Nine away, killing their horses. Lacking the means to\nsuccessfully attack Rivendell, where Frodo and his companions took\nrefuge, the Nazgûl were forced to retreat to Mordor on foot and stop\ntheir hunt for the Ring.\n\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields\n\n[Gandalf confronted by the Witch-King]\n\nReturning to Mordor in complete failure, the Nazgûl were forced to\nabandon their hunt for the Ring. At this point, the Nine received new\nmounts to replace their horses: Fell beasts. With his new mount, the\nWitch-king attacked the ruined city of Osgiliath with an army of Orcs\nand secured it. After this, he made way for the assault on Minas Tirith,\nleading Sauron's forces during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. During\nthe battle, the Witch-king confronted Gandalf the White when attempting\nto enter the city. However, before the Witch-king could engage Gandalf\nin battle, the forces of Rohan arrived. The Witch-king immediately left\nGandalf to deal with the new threat against Mordor's forces.\n\nThe Witch-king attacked King Théoden on the battlefield. As Théoden was\ncrushed by his horse, the lord of the Nazgûl prepared to finish him off.\nHowever, Théoden's niece Éowyn and Meriadoc Brandybuck rode up on\nhorseback, and she confronted the Witch-king.\n\n[The Witch-king's death]\n\nEngaging the Witch-king in battle, Éowyn killed his fell-beast. The\nWitch-king, however, was unaffected by this and attacked Éowyn with his\nmace. After injuring her arm, he prepared to kill her before Meriadoc\nstabbed him in the leg from behind with his Barrow-blade, which was of\nWesternesse make. Injured, the Witch-king screamed in pain and Éowyn\nstabbed her sword into his crown and body, thus killing the lord of the\nNazgûl and fulfilling the prophecy of Glorfindel. (For it had been said\nthat no mortal _man_ could kill the Witch-king.)\n\nBattle of the Morannon and Defeat\n\nDuring Battle of the Black Gate the remaining eight Nazgûl, mounted on\nFell beasts, attacked the Army of the West. Eventually, however, the\nNazgûl were confronted by the Eagles, led by Gwaihir.\n\n[The Nazgûl caught in the firestorm and destroyed]\n\nSimultaneously, Frodo Baggins claimed the Ring for himself near the\nfires of Mount Doom. Sauron immediately became aware of Frodo, as well\nas his folly. Enraged and frantic, Sauron ordered the Nazgûl to fly with\nall possible speed to Mount Doom and seize the Ring.\n\nHowever, the Nazgûl failed; the Ring was cast into the fires of Mount\nDoom when Gollum bit Frodo's finger and accidentally fell into the\nCracks of Doom himself, with the ring. Sauron was immediately defeated\nby the loss of the Ring, Mount Doom underwent a gigantic volcanic\neruption and all eight Nazgûl were destroyed, their form and power\ndissipating forever.\n\nWeapons and Abilities\n\n[The Witch-king]\n\nThe Nazgûl were sustained by the power of Sauron. The Witch-king in\nparticular was difficult to slay, for any weapon that struck him would\nbe destroyed. The Nazgûl's own weapons included long swords of steel and\ndaggers. Their leader possessed a powerful black mace as well. Their\narsenal of deadly armaments was not confined to physical means; they\nalso had powerful voices, which brought terror into the hearts of\nmortals and a general aura of dread. They wore hauberks of silver mail\nand had enhanced senses of hearing and smell.\n\nThe Nine could not see during the day as mortals do; instead they see\nshadowy forms. During the night, they see many signs and forms invisible\nto mortal eyes; it is at night that they are to be feared most. They can\nsmell the blood of living things that they desire and hate. Their\npresence can be felt as a troubling of the heart, and they can more\nkeenly feel the presence of others. At all times, they sense the\npresence of the Ring and are drawn to it.\n\nThey were surrounded by an aura of terror, which affected all living\ncreatures; their aura (called the Black Breath) could be toxic to those\nhapless enough to come near them. Of course, their horrible cries put\nmany a battle-hardened warrior to flight as well. Some of the Nazgûl\nappear to have been accomplished sorcerers and used magic to devastating\neffect. The fear the Nine inspired was one of their greatest strengths.\nAccording to Gandalf, if Sauron regained the One, they would become\nvastly more powerful. However, it is unclear as to how. However, as\nSauron's strength grew through the books, the Nazgûl became obviously\nmore powerful. In _The Fellowship of the Ring_, the Nazgûl's cries were\nsimply unnerving to the hobbits, and they appeared to be physically\nweak, as Aragorn managed to hold off five of the\nRingwraiths single-handedly on Weathertop. In _The Return of the King_\nhowever, their cries are powerful enough to send all but the most\nstout-hearted of Gondor's defenders into a state of helpless terror, and\nthe Witch-king in particular has become so powerful that he challenged\nGandalf the White (which of the two is the more powerful is not\nrevealed).\n\nWeaknesses\n\n[A Nazgûl set on fire]\n\nThough the Ringwraiths were among the greatest of Sauron's servants,\nthey also had certain weaknesses that could be used against them. One of\nthese was daylight itself. With the exception of the Witch-king of\nAngmar, none of them (especially Khamûl) could operate as well under the\nSun and generally feared it.\n\nAll the Ringwraiths but the Witch-king feared water, although it seems\nthis weakness was abandoned by Tolkien in the published version because\nit was an idea difficult to sustain.\n\nAt Weathertop, Aragorn used fire to drive the Ringwraiths away from\nFrodo. Even the Witch-king feared fire. At the Ford of Bruinen, Aragorn\nand the hobbits that accompanied Frodo used it to assist Glorfindel and\ndrive the Ringwraiths into the raging water.\n\nIf an enemy was strong enough so to resist their aura of dread, then the\nRingwraiths (with the exception of the Witch-King) had little real power\nover them individually.\n\nHeroes of Middle-earth such as Aragorn, Gandalf, and Glorfindel could\nsingle-handedly face a Ringwraith and defeat or at least elude them,\nprovided that they were not confronted by multiple Ringwraiths or the\nWitch-king. However, only a few could resist them all at the same time.\nGlorfindel was able to in fact instill fear in the Nazgûl's hearts.\n\nMounts\n\n[The Witch-king mounted on his Fell-beast]\n\nAt the start of the War of the Ring, the Nine rode black horses\ndescended from horses stolen from Rohan, which they relied heavily on\nfor transport. However, after the encounter with Glorfindel at Ford of\nBruinen, the Black Riders lost their horses, which were killed in the\nflood.\n\nReturning to Mordor by foot to regroup, the Nazgûl received winged\ncreatures from Sauron in addition to new horses. With these fell beasts,\nthe nine attacked the ruined city of Osgiliath in order to clear the way\nfor a siege on Minas Tirith. Subsequently, the Nazgûl used the fell\nbeasts to their advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the\nBattle of the Morannon, but most of all in attempting to seek and find\nthe ringbearer, Frodo.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term _NAZGÛL_, which literally means “RING-WRAITH,” comes from the\nBlack Speech words _nazg_ (“ring”) and _gûl_ (“wraith”).\n\nThe rarely used Quenya name for Nazgûl is ÚLAIRI; from this, it can\nbe conjectured that the Sindarin term is ULAER.\n\nOther Titles\n\n- FELL RIDERS - BLACK WINGS - NINE RIDERS - BLACK\nRIDERS - SHRIEKERS - WRAITHS ON WINGS (by Gollum) - THE\nRINGWRAITHS\n\nIndividual Titles\n\n- The Witch-king of Angmar was often referred to as LORD OF THE NAZGÛL\n\n   and THE BLACK CAPTAIN.\n\n- Khamûl, second-in-command, was called the SHADOW OF THE EAST.",

    "text": "The ÑOLDOR (Quenya; IPA: or in Third Age Middle-earth ; meaning _those\nwith knowledge_; adjectival ÑOLDORIN; or TA ) were the second clan of\nthe Elves. According to legend, the clan was originally known as the\nTATYAR (; meaning _second ones_; adjectival TATYARIN; ) and was founded\nby Tata, the second elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his spouse Tatië, and\ntheir 54 companions - but it was Finwë, the first ÑOLDO to come to\nValinor with Oromë, who became their king and led most of them to\nValinor. The Ñoldor who come to Aman spoke Quenya, or more specifically\nthe widely-known Ñoldorin dialect of it. However, fully half the Tatyar\nrefused the call of the Valar, and became counted among the Avari.\n\nThey were also known as NOLDOLI,''' ''' _Deep Elves_, _Golodhrim_,\n_Aulendur_ ('Servant of Aulë' ) and _Golug_. The singular form of the\nnoun is _Ñoldo_ and the adjective is _Ñoldorin_. They were the Second\nClan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the\nVanyar and the Teleri. They typically had dark hair (except for those\nwho had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of\nFinarfin).\n\nThe Ñoldor are accounted as the greatest of the Elves in lore and\nsmithcraft. Fëanor (son of Finwë by Míriel) was the greatest of their\ncraftsmen, and their second and briefest-reigning High King. When Melkor\nkilled Finwë and stole the Silmarils, Fëanor renamed Melkor: _Morgoth_\n(“Black Enemy”), and persuaded the Ñoldor to pursue him to Middle-earth\nand wage war against him.\n\nHistory\n\nIn Valinor, the Ñoldorin Elves were ruled by the High King Finwë. The\nÑoldor became the friends and students of Aulë, due to their love of\ncraft and the knowledge Aulë imparted to them. Then Finwë's wife Miriel\ngave birth to her only son, Fëanor, and was spent in mind and spirit.\nMiriel's spirit passed to the Halls of Mandos, depriving Finwë of joy in\nValinor. But Fëanor proved to be a mighty Elf Lord; subtle in speech,\nand the most skilled craftsmen of the Ñoldor. When he was come to his\nprime, Fëanor wrought the Silmarils, the great jewels that contained the\nlight of the Two Trees. But he was prideful and arrogant, and did not\ntake kindly to his father's second marriage to Indis of the Vanyar. From\nher Finwë fathered two more children who would found their own houses;\nFingolfin and Finarfin. This was the first cause of disunion in the\nHouse of Finwë, as Fëanor had little love for his half siblings.\n\nWhen Melkor was released from captivity, he sought to exploit that\ndisunion in a bid to gain the Silmarils and estrange the Ñoldor from the\nValar. He spread lies amongst the Ñoldor, claiming that the Valar were\nkeeping them in Aman so they would not be able to rule the lands of\nMiddle-earth, and that Fingolfin and Fëanor were plotting against each\nother. When Fëanor drew sword against Fingolfin, the Valar intervened\nand banished Fëanor from Valmar to the mountain fortress of Formenos.\nThe Ñoldor grew restless as they began to hunger for the unguarded lands\nof Middle-earth.\n\nBut worse was to come. When Melkor destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor\nand slew Finwe, he also stole the Silmarils and fled to Middle-earth. An\nenraged Fëanor then spoke before all of the Ñoldor and gave an\nimpassioned speech. He urged them to leave the land of the Valar and\ntake up kingdoms in Middle-earth, where they could rule as they wished.\nMany of the royal line, including Galadriel, wished indeed to see\nMiddle-earth and rule their own fair kingdoms. Fëanor then swore a\nterrible Oath to reclaim the Silmarils, with the promise of retribution\nfor any who should withhold them. The Ñoldorin Host gathered, though the\ngreater part followed Fingolfin, trusting his wisdom over Fëanor's\narrogance.\n\nBefore the First Age the Ñoldor led by Fëanor went north and demanded\nthat the Falmari let them use their ships. When the Falmari refused,\nFëanor and his host destroyed the port of Alqualondë, which had been\nbuilt by the Teleri, committing the first Kinslaying. Fëanor's host then\ntook possession of the ships. Not long afterwards, the Ñoldor were\nconfronted by Mandos, the Doomsman of the Valar. Mandos delivered the\nProphecy of the North, pronouncing doom on the Ñoldor for the Kinslaying\nand warning that if they continued they would not recover the Silmarils\nand moreover that there would be great grief in the tragedy that would\nbefall them. At this, some of the Ñoldor who had no hand in the\nKinslaying, including Finarfin son of Finwë by Indis, returned to\nValinor, and the Valar forgave them. Other Ñoldor led by Fingolfin son\nof Finwë by Indis (some of whom were blameless in the Kinslaying)\nremained determined to leave Valinor for Middle-earth. Prominent among\nthese others was Finarfin's daughter, Galadriel.\n\nFëanor and his host crossed the sea to Middle-earth leaving those led by\nFingolfin, his half-brother, behind. Upon his arrival in Middle-earth,\nFëanor had the ships burned. When Fingolfin and his host discovered\ntheir betrayal, they went farther north and crossed the sea by means of\nthe Helcaraxë. Many of them died while crossing the paths of the\nHelcaraxë and the cruel hills of ice, including Turgon's wife Elenwë.\nThe departure of the Ñoldor out of the Undying Lands marked the\nbeginning of the First Age, and the years of the Sun. At last, the Host\nof Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth, and their journey through the\nHelcaraxë was one of the greatest deeds of renown. Few deeds of the\nÑoldor would ever surpass this, but the bitterness of the crossing had\nkindled fresh hatred for the House of Fëanor.\n\nFëanor's company was soon attacked by Morgoth. When Fëanor rode too far\nfrom his retinue during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath (year 1 of the First Age)\nhe was slain by Gothmog and the other Balrogs.\n\nBecause Fëanor had taken the ships and left the remaining Ñoldor in\nAman, the royal houses of the Ñoldor were feuding. But recently\nMaedhros, eldest son of Feanor, had been captured by Morgoth. Fingon,\nson of Fingolfin, who remembered great friendship between himself and\nMaedhros, rescued him from the slopes of Thangorodrim. For this deed the\nÑoldor rejoiced and their feud was ended. By right Maedhros had\nsucceeded Fëanor as King, but in gratitude he renounced the Kingship to\nhis uncle Fingolfin, who became the third High King of the Ñoldor. His\nbrothers did not agree to this, and began to refer to themselves as the\nDisplaced, because the High Kingship had passed them by. Nevertheless,\nthe princes of the Ñoldor established great realms in Beleriand, and to\nmany it seemed the words of Feanor were justified. Here the Ñoldor were\nmighty and lordly, rather than at the bottom of the hierarchy in\nValinor. And for a while there was peace between the Houses of Fingolfin\nand Fëanor. But the House of Fëanor was still bound by the Oath, which\nin turn was tied to the Curse of Mandos.\n\nFingolfin reigned long in the land of Hithlum, and his younger son\nTurgon built the hidden kingdom Gondolin. Fingolfin's reign was marked\nby warfare against Morgoth and in the year 75 of the First Age the\nÑoldor started the Siege of Angband, the great fortress of Morgoth. But\nin the year FA 455 the siege was broken by Morgoth (in the Dagor\nBragollach), and Fingolfin perceived that the war against Morgoth was\nutterly futile. In his fury, Fingolfin rode to Angband and challenged\nMorgoth to single combat. Reluctantly, Morgoth came forth to duel him.\nFingolfin dealt Morgoth seven wounds from which he never healed, but at\nlast Fingolfin was slain. Thorondor, Lord of Eagles, scratched Morgoth's\nface and took Fingolfin's body. His eldest son Fingon succeeded him as\nHigh King of the Ñoldor.\n\nIn the year 471, Maedhros organized an all-out attack on Morgoth and\nthis led to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. The battle was a great disaster for\nthe Ñoldor, and Fingon the Valiant was slain. He was succeeded by his\nbrother Turgon, but Fingon's son Gil-galad was sent to the Havens.\n\nTurgon had withdrawn to Gondolin and tried to keep the kingdom hidden\nfrom Morgoth. He was so successful that even most of the Ñoldor didn't\nknow where it was located, and he was High King in name alone. In FA\n510, Gondolin was betrayed by Maeglin and sacked. During the attack\nTurgon was killed; however many of his people escaped and found their\nway south. As Turgon had no sons, the Kingship passed back to Fingon's\nson Gil-galad, becoming the sixth and last High King of the Ñoldor.\n\nFinally, the Valar came down to Middle-earth and in the year 583 the War\nof Wrath was fought and Morgoth was cast into the Void. However,\nBeleriand sank into the sea, except for a part of Ossiriand which became\nLindon, and a few isles. The defeat of Morgoth marked the beginning of\nthe Second Age. The Ñoldor were once again summoned to Valinor and the\nCurse of Mandos was laid to rest. Some departed because they had grown\nweary of grief, but many refused to leave the lands they had laboured in\nfor so long. Moreover others refused out of pride, unwilling to\nrelinquish their high status in Middle-earth. The last of the great\nleaders was Galadriel, who stayed due to her pride, reasoning that her\nfamily had never done any wrong and that she was mightier in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nGil-galad founded a new kingdom at Lindon, and ruled throughout the\nSecond Age, longer than any of the High Kings except for Finwë. He was\nalso accepted as High King by the Ñoldor of Eregion. But at the end of\nthe Second Age his allies in Numenor lost their island and Elendil,\nIsildur and Anárion came to Middle-earth and they founded the kingdoms\nof Arnor and Gondor.\n\nDespite their prosperity and power, the Ñoldor were not at peace. While\nthey had refused Valinor in favour of retaining their lordship in the\nlands of Middle-earth, they still desired the bliss that Valinor\npromised. It was the doom of Elves that, though immortal, in the land of\nmortals they felt the weariness of time and change. This weariness only\ngrew as the years went by. In Valinor the lands were hallowed and\nenchanted, allowing the Elves to live in eternal bliss, but in mortal\nlands there was no such power to sustain them.\n\nIt was at this time that Annatar, Lord of Gifts, came forth with the\noffer of the very bliss that the Elves desired. Gil-galad, Galadriel and\nElrond distrusted this mysterious figure and shunned him. But in\nEregion, Annatar's teachings were held in awe by the Ñoldor Elves and\nthey received him gladly. Their leader was Celebrimbor, the grandson of\nFeanor himself, and he had inherited much of his grandfather's\nskill. Such was Annatar's knowledge that he was believed to be an\nemissary of Aulë, as he first proclaimed. Annatar taught Celebrimbor the\nart of crafting Rings of Power. In secret Celebrimbor forged the three\ngreatest rings; Narya, Nenya, and Vilya. These rings were imbued with a\nspiritual power that could protect and preserve all things unstained,\nwarding off the effects of time. Thus the desire of the Elves was\nfulfilled in the making of these rings. The three were secretly\ndistributed to some of the High Elf Lords. Galadriel received Nenya,\nGil-galad received Vilya and Narya was given to Círdan. But they were\ndeceived, for Annatar had crafted the rings for a different purpose; to\nbind all the bearers together as slaves. Annatar was actually Sauron in\ndisguise, and he treacherously forged a ruling ring to govern all the\nother rings and their respective bearers. However, when Sauron placed\nthe One Ring on his finger, the Elves suddenly became aware of him due\nto the powerful connection between the rings. They heard Sauron speak\nthe dreaded words of doom, and the Elves understood that he would be\nmaster of their own minds. The Elves narrowly avoided this trap and took\noff their rings. Gil-galad gave Vilya to Elrond for safekeeping, and to\nuse it if Gil-galad should fall.\n\nEnraged, Sauron declared war, demanding all the rings were his by right\nas they were made from his craft. Eregion was attacked and destroyed,\nand Celebrimbor perished. Before his death Sauron interrogated him as to\nthe whereabouts of the Three Rings he had forged alone, but Celebrimbor\nwithheld the truth and died from torture. Thus the knowledge of the\ncraft perished with him also.\n\nBy this time Sauron had replaced his master Morgoth as the Dark Lord. He\nhad deceived the Númenóreans and managed to return from Numenor to his\nrefuge in Mordor. But in his absence he had overlooked the growing power\nof Gil-galad. Sauron hated both the Númenóreans and the Ñoldor, and\ntried to destroy Gondor before it could take root, but Gil-galad's\nforces thwarted him. Then Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel and formed\nthe Last of Alliance of Elves and Men, a mighty host of Noldor and\nNumenoreans.\n\nThe host set out for Mordor and defeated Sauron's forces in the Battle\nof Dagorlad and finally in the Siege of Barad-dûr. There Gil-galad\nproved mighty enough to duel with Sauron himself, and with Elendil's\nhelp they inflicted enough wounds on Sauron that the Dark Lord's mortal\nform was destroyed. But Gil-galad was burned to death by the heat of\nSauron's hand, and so ended the High Kingship of the Ñoldor. No new High\nKing was elected, as Gil-galad left no heir and no one else had a strong\nenough claim. For this reason, the High Kingship of the Ñoldor was said\nto have passed overseas, to the Ñoldor of Valinor, ruled by Finarfin,\nthe third son of Finwë who had never left. Because Tuor had been adopted\nby Turgon as a son, and had married his daughter Idril, Tuor's mortal\ndescendants claimed the title High King: therefore, Elros became first\nHigh King of Numenor, signifying this with the prefix Tar- (and later in\nAdûnaic Ar-). After the Downfall of Numenor, Elendil and his heirs of\nthe older, northern line named themselves High Kings of Arnor, later\nsignifying this with the royal prefix Ar(a)- in their names. Tuor's\nheirs did not have a valid claim to the High Kingship of the Ñoldor,\nalthough his heir Elrond, who chose Elvish immortality, later was\nreckoned as a leader of the Ñoldor.\n\nWith Sauron defeated and the One Ring lost, the Elves were free to use\nthe three rings to create their enchanted kingdoms. However, Cirdan\ngave his to Gandalf to aid him in his labours. In at least two realms,\nRivendell and Lothlórien, the bliss of the Eldar was preserved. Those\nElves who dwelt within these regions again tasted the bliss of Valinor\nand did not feel the weight of time. In the Third Age, the Ñoldor\ndwindled, and by the end of the Third Age the only Ñoldor remaining in\nMiddle-earth were in Rivendell, with the exception of Galadriel in\nLothlórien. The Three rings were free from any evil, having been made\nwithout Sauron ever seeing them. But since they were still made by the\nsame art as the other rings, the Three were still bound to the One Ring.\nWith the One Ring's destruction and Sauron's permanent defeat, the power\nof the three rings faded and the last of the Ñoldor Elves began to grow\nweary again. Eventually, Galadriel and Elrond took the ship for Valinor\nand departed Middle-earth and Lothlórien was abandoned. From the Fourth\nAge and beyond Rivendell was the only remaining Ñoldorian settlement\nleft in Middle Earth, ruled by Elladan and Elrohir who remained behind\nwhen Elrond left.\n\nHigh Kings\n\n1. Finwë, first High King 2. Fëanor, first son of Finwë 3. Fingolfin,\nsecond son of Finwë. Though some supported Maedhros, the\n\n   eldest son of Feanor, Maedhros himself laid aside his claim and\n   supported Fingolfin instead.\n\n4. Fingon, first son of Fingolfin. 5. Turgon, second son of Fingolfin.\n6. Ereinion Gil-galad, son of Fingon according to the Silmarillion\n\nAfter Gil-galad's death, the High Kingship in Middle-earth under the\nÑoldor came to an end. Of the descendents of Finwë, the descendants of\nElros (the Kings of Arnor) did claim the title High King but there is no\nindication that this referred anything other than a High Kingship over\nthe Dúnedain. It is unclear whether Elros and his brother Elrond were\nconsidered eligible at all, but Elrond never claimed Kingship, implying\nthat they were not. However, at this point, the number of Ñoldor\nremaining in Middle Earth was few, and Elrond might have simply deemed\nthe question moot.\n\nAccording to the Silmarillion, Finarfin took the kingship of those\nÑoldor who remained in Aman during the Exile, though whether he was\nconsidered a “High King” or not (either at the time of the Exile and\nafter the War of Wrath) is unclear. Another possibility is that in Aman\nthere was no High King other than Ingwë. Although Miriel had renounced\nher right to re-embody (as per the rules of the Statute of Finwë and\nMíriel), there is no reason that Finwë might not have done so (and, in\nfact, the text of the Silmarillion implies that eventually he did).\nSimilarly, as lineal heir to Turgon, Earendil the Mariner might have\nmade a claim. The question of who held kingship over the Ñoldor after\nthe War of the Last Alliance remains unanswered.\n\nMuch of this speculation stems from attempts to divine the rules of\ninheritance and succession for the Ñoldor. Among humans, the “divine\nright” implied by Tolkien follows the rules of primogeniture. On the\nother hand, elves are immortal, and can reincarnate even if they are\nphysically killed. Iron-clad rules for succession may simply not exist.\nSupporting this viewpoint is the controversy between Fingolfin and\nMaedhros. It can be read that Maedhros had, but gave up, the “right” to\nHigh Kingship; on the other hand, these might have simply been the two\nstrongest contenders for the position. Asserting but giving up a right\nwould automatically forestall claims from his younger brothers, and\nprovide legitimacy to Fingolfin that elves of every party would\nrecognize.\n\nEtymology\n\n_Ñoldor_ is a Quenya term meaning 'those with knowledge'. _LACHEND_ was\none Sindarin name that other Elves gave them, which translates as\n'flame-eyed'.\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the early versions of Tolkien's Middle-earth mythology (see: _The\nHistory of Middle-earth_), the ÑOLDOR were most often called _NOLDOLI_\n(not _Ñoldoli_) or “GNOMES”. They were still called Gnomes in early\neditions of _The Hobbit_. They were also the ones who spoke the language\nthat later became Sindarin (then called Gnomish). Beren and Luthien\n(2017) reintroduces the use of Gnomes and Noldoli in the complete tale.\n\nThe spelling _Ñoldor_ rather than _Noldor_ is used in later writings,\nbut even in earlier versions the name _Ñoldo_ came from a Primitive\nQuendian stem *NGolodō, which led to _NGoldo_ (Ñoldo) in Quenya and\n_GOLODH_ in Sindarin. However, by the Third Age, Quenya as it was spoken\nin Middle-earth had voiced the “ng” phoneme as a regular “n”, making the\neffective pronunciation during the Age as _Noldor_.\n\nThe family tree given above is correct in the placement of Orodreth and\nGil-galad: Orodreth was Angrod's son, and Gil-galad was Orodreth's son,\nthus the grandson of Angrod and great-grandson of Finarfin, and brother\nto Finduilas. These are wrongly placed in the published _Silmarillion_.\n(See Orodreth and Gil-galad articles for details). Argon, the third son\nof Fingolfin, does not appear in the published _Silmarillion_ at all.",
