A fragment of the blade remained within Frodo's\nwound, working its way toward his heart and threatening to turn Frodo\ninto a wraith. Elrond was able to remove the shard and heal the wound,\nbut each year on the anniversary of receiving the wound Frodo became\nseriously ill. Only his eventual departure to Eldamar, also known as the\nUndying Lands, offered a permanent cure.\n\n\n\n_Athelas_ (or _Kingsfoil_) is known to slow the poisonous effect of the\nMorgul-blade, though true healing (usually Elven healing) is necessary\nin order to fully cure a victim.

I would have trees and grass about me that do not die -\n    here in the land that is mine.” Celebrimbor, who is in love with\n    her, remakes the jewel and gives it to her. He learned the art of\n    elven blacksmithing in Gondolin when he was a friend of Enerdhil and\n    ever his friendly, competitive rival. Galadriel then passes the\n    stone to her daughter Celebrian, who in turn gives it to her\n    daughter Arwen. Galadriel keeps it once more in Lothlorien to pass\n    it on to Aragorn.\n",

    "text": "BILBO'S MITHRIL SHIRT was a shirt of chain mail, alternately described\nas a vest and a coat, made from mithril. It was moved several times\nduring the course of the series, from Smaug's hoard to Bilbo to the\nMathom-house to Frodo. It was taken by the Orcs of Cirith Ungol from\nFrodo, but was later with the Mouth of Sauron, as he showed it to\nGandalf, Aragorn, and the other leaders outside the Morannon in the\nBattle of the Black Gate. It was later returned to Frodo.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of the shirt are largely unknown, though it was said to have\nbeen made for a young Elf prince long ago. It eventually came to be part\nof the Dwarven treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain. It was found by\nthe dragon Smaug and added to his treasure heap. Here, it was given by\nThorin II Oakenshield to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who wore it during\nthe Battle of Five Armies. After returning to the Shire, Bilbo loaned\nthe shirt to the Mathom-house. Before departing the Shire for Rivendell,\nBilbo reclaimed the shirt and wore it on that journey.\n\nMany years later it was given by Bilbo to his nephew Frodo Baggins as\nFrodo set out on his quest to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Frodo\nwore the chain shirt under his tunic unknown to the rest of the\nFellowship. It was discovered when, during a skirmish in the mines of\nMoria, an Orc chieftain stabbed Frodo with a spear. The shirt\nprevented what would have been a lethal wound, leaving Frodo badly\nbruised but otherwise uninjured.\n\nThe shirt was confiscated from Frodo in the Tower of Cirith Ungol. The\ntwo squadrons of orcs that captured Frodo fought over the valuable\nshirt, and most were killed during the conflict. One of the two Orc\nleaders, Shagrat, survived the fight and seized the shirt, escaping the\ntower with it. The shirt eventually ended up in the possession of the\nMouth of Sauron at Barad-dûr, where he presented it to Gandalf at the\nBlack Gates as false evidence that Frodo had failed in his quest. In his\nwrath Gandalf retrieved the shirt. The wizard later returned it to Frodo\nafter the destruction of the Ring."

    "text": "The NAUGLAMÍR was a necklace crafted by the Dwarves in the First Age\nwhich played an important role during the final parts of the _Narn i\nChîn Húrin_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter Húrin brought the treasures of Nargothrond to Doriath, Thingol\nsummoned Dwarves of Nogrod to Menegroth and invited them to work the\ntreasure into jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.\n\nThe Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above\nall but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost\nfinished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves\nof Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the\nSilmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\n\nEnthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the dwarves\ndemanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them.\nThingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an\nimpertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves slew him. Two escaped to\nNogrod and told a much different story to their kinsmen, persuading the\ncity to march on Doriath.\n\nAfter the Fall of Doriath, the Dwarves of Nogrod marched homewards with\nthe stolen Nauglamír and the rest of the treasures of that land but\nBeren, at the head of an army of Laiquendi and Ents slew the dwarves.\nThe treasure was cast into the Ascar save the Nauglamír, which Beren\ngave to Lúthien.\n\nAfter Beren and Lúthien's final deaths, the necklace was inherited by\ntheir son, Dior, who became the second King of Doriath. When the Sons of\nFëanor heard that the inheritor of the throne of Doriath, they demanded\nthat he surrender it to them or become their enemy. When he refused,\nthis brought about the Second Kinslaying as the Sons of Fëanor, seeking\nthe Silmaril in accordance with the Oath of Fëanor, attacked Doriath.\nDior's daughter, Elwing, escaped the kinslaying with the Nauglamír,\nfleeing to the Mouths of Sirion.\n\nIn the Third Kinslaying, the Sons of Fëanor attacked the Elven havens in\nthe Mouths of Sirion, still trying to obtain the Silmaril within the\nNauglamír but Elwing cast herself into the sea with it rather than\nsurrender the gem to Maedhros and Maglor. The Nauglamír was lost, while\nElwing and the Silmaril were saved by the Vala Ulmo.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn an earlier myth of First Age lore that preceded the final stories in\n_The Silmarillion_, namely the Lost Tale _The Nauglafring_, the\nNauglamír (named the NAUGLAFRING) is more important: the necklace\nbecomes caught behind a tree branch when Thingol is riding outside the\nGirdle of Melian and is attacked by the Dwarves. Thingol is unhorsed and\nslain. Following this, Melian's protection is lifted and Doriath is\nsacked.",

    "lotr_page_id": "716",
    "text": "STING was an Elven shortsword made in Gondolin during the First\nAge. After wielding it during the Quest for Erebor, Bilbo Baggins had it\nengraved with the Sindarin text, _Maegnas aen estar nin dagnir in yngyl\nim_. Translated into English, it reads, “_Sting_ is my name; I am the\nspider's bane.” The Appendix of ''The Silmarillion _defines_ _the\nelement _maeg'' in Sindarin as meaning “sharp” or “piercing”. During the\nThird Age, it was wielded by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise\nGamgee.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSting was an ancient Elvish blade made by weapon-smiths in Gondolin.\nWhen Orcs or goblins were within an undetermined radius of it, the blade\nglowed blue, alerting the wielder and others who could see it to their\npresence. It had been lost during the Fall of Gondolin, the same battle\nin which Turgon fell and Glamdring was taken. It appeared as a curved\nblade with a silver loop or spiral design on it, later runes were added\nto it by Bilbo after his adventures. These runes seem to have been made\nby the Elves as they are in Sindarin.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Bilbo and his dwarven companions found Sting in a\nTroll-hoard alongside two other elven blades: Glamdring and Orcrist.\nThough just a dagger by the standard of elves, Sting made a perfect\nshort sword for a Hobbit, although it was still rather small, as Bilbo\ninitially chose to wear it “inside his breeches” and was still able\nto travel and even run without any apparent inconvenience.\n\nJust before his nephew embarked on his quest to Mordor from Rivendell,\nBilbo gave Sting to Frodo. Sam then took the weapon from his (seemingly\ndead) master and used it to good effect against Shelob on the borders of\nMordor. After the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, Frodo\nentrusted Sting to Sam and it became an heirloom of the Gamgee family.\n\nGollum, who disliked anything made by the Elves, was afraid of Sting.\nThis fear aided Bilbo when he confronted Gollum in the Cave at the base\nof the Misty Mountains in _The Hobbit_. It also helped Frodo and Sam\nsubdue Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings_. Orcs also had an instinctive\nfear of these weapons and hated any who carried them.\n\nAs is fitting for a blade of Gondolin, Sting could easily cut through\nthe webs of the offspring of Ungoliant, including the evil Shelob and\nthe spiders of Mirkwood. Bilbo had named the weapon _Sting_ after he had\n“stung” one of them with it. In The Hobbit when Bilbo wears the One\nRing, and defends himself against a spider, he names the blade “Sting”.\nThe narrator describes the spider's lack of acquaintance with creatures\nwith such stings, and evidently this was also Bilbo's presumption in\nnaming it as such. Sting was like Glamdring and Orcrist in that “being\nthe work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a\ncold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.” But only Sting was\ndefinitively described as glowing blue, or glittering with blue flame at\nits edges.\n",

    "text": "The BOOK OF MAZARBUL was begun in TA 2989, upon Balin's return to Moria.\nThe book recounted the expedition's experiences within Moria, including\na battle with the Orcs that inhabited the old halls of Khazad-dûm, in\nwhich Balin's Dwarves were victorious. They settled in the Twenty-first\nHall, above the East-gate, and Balin himself ruled his new domain from\nthe old Chamber of Records, also called the Chamber of Mazarbul. Over\nthe next five years, the Dwarves seem to have settled quite successfully\ninto their new home, exploring under the Mountains as far as the\nWest-gate of Moria, recovering Durin's Axe and apparently other\npriceless items made of Mithril.\n\nThe Lordship of Balin was short-lived. Ori, who was with him in Moria,\nrecorded in the last pages of the Book how an army of Orcs came\nunexpectedly out of the east, slaying Balin outside the East-gate. The\nDwarves defended themselves, but they were beleaguered from the east by\nthe Orcs and from the west by the mysterious Watcher in the Water. Their\nlast stand was in the Chamber of Mazarbul, where the Orcs eventually\novercame and destroyed them.\n\nThe victorious Orcs seem not to have understood the significance of the\nBook, so that rather than carrying it off or destroying it, they left it\nto rot in the Chamber. There it was found twenty-four years later by the\nCompany of the Ring, burned, slashed and blood-stained, and missing a\nnumber of pages, but still readable in some parts. Gandalf passed it to\nGimli to return to King Dáin, after which nothing more is said of it.\n\n\nText in the Book\n\nPage 1\n\n_We drove out the orcs from the Great Gate and guardroom and took the\nFirst Hall.
