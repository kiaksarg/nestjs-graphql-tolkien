He sang songs and laughed with the Hobbits; they stayed\nat his ent-house near Derndingle, where the Entmoot was held. Bregalad\nlater played an important role in the attack on Isengard, as he fought\nalong side with Treebeard, and he nearly captured Saruman himself. After\nthe water from Isen River had flooded Isengard, he stood guard at the\nbottom of the stairs of Orthanc. After the War of the Ring, his furthur\nfate is unknown, but he possibly died in Fourth Age.",

He greatly\ntroubled the Dwarves and Men living in the lands North of the Wilderland\nand had stolen a great deal of their treasure.

A description of Lady Finduilas is\ngiven in Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings _The Return of the King_:\n“She was a lady of great beauty and gentle heart. Denethor loved her, in\nhis fashion, more dearly than any other, unless it were the elder of the\nsons that she bore him. But it seemed to men that she withered in the\nguarded city, as a flower of the seaward vales set upon a barren rock.\nThe shadow in the east filled her with horror, and she turned her eyes\never south to the sea that she missed.”\n\nIn TA 2978, she gave birth to a son Boromir, who became loved by his\nfather. In TA 2983, she gave birth to her second son, Faramir, and after\ngrew weak. In TA 2984, Ecthelion suddenly died, and Denethor became\nSteward of Gondor. Her health dwindled and she fell ill, and four years\nlater she died young at the age of only thirty-eight (considering her\nheritage as a Dúnedain).\n\n\nLegacy\n\nHer death greatly affected Denethor and he never remarried, becoming\nmore and more grim and silent than he was before.\" It was not long\nafter her death that he “would sit long alone in his tower deep in\nthought, foreseeing that the assault of Mordor would come in his\ntime.” Thus he began using the Palantír of Minas Tirith, and the\ndespair fed to his mind led to his ultimate insanity and suicide some\nthirty-one years later.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHer name originated after Finduilas, an Elf Maiden of the First\nAge. which was a Sindarin word that meant 'Hair- ?'.",

Biography\nBeing a lady of nature, she lived in the woods and never came to the\ncity but she knew much of things and was very wise. Nellas was young\nduring the latter-half of the fourth century First Age and it was during\nthat time that Túrin had come to Doriath as a boy. With the blessings of\nMelian, she befriended him and became his teacher and he learned much\nabout the wilderness and nature. She also taught him an older and richer\nform of Sindarin and the many manners of its pronunciation. As he began\nto grow into manhood, he drifted away from her but she still continued\nto watch over him be it in secrecy. Sitting in a tree watching over him,\nshe witnessed the incident between Túrin and Saeros and saw that Saeros\nhad indeed provoked Túrin and was the cause of his own peril. Summoned\nto appear before the King in one of the few times she walked in the\ncity, she told him about what happen in the woods with great difficulty.\nAfter the King pronounced his judgment, she wept over Túrin’s departure\nand sought to find him but presumably she never saw him again. Her fate\nis unknown in the latter days of the First Age. Etymology Although there\nappears to be no clear origin of the name NELLAS, it is likely to have\nbeen Sindarin and may have come from the Sindarin words NELLAD, NELLA or\nNELLADEL, which all mean “the sound of bells” (or “to sound the bells”),\nor perhaps the word NELL, meaning “bell”. The element NEL- may also\nconnect with Elvish words for the number “three”, and the final -LAS\ncould mean “leaf” (as in the name LEGOLAS, Greenleaf), though it is not\napparent why a child should be called by a name meaning something like\n“three leaves”.

This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the First\nAge where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies\nof Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind, and eventually brought ruin\nupon themselves.\n\nCaranthir's realm was in Thargelion in the East Beleriand, and was\nsometimes called Dor Caranthir (Caranthir's land); his abode was on the\nshores of Lake Helevorn. Because his realm bordered the great\nDwarfish Kingdoms of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains, he\nbecame very wealthy probably controlling much of the trade coming\nthrough the Dwarf-Road.\n\n\n\nHe rescued the Edain lady Haleth and her people, the Haladin, as they\nwere besieged by Orcs. He then saw the bravery and valour of Men, and\noffered the Haladin settlement in the North, but Haleth, thanking him,\nrefused and left, eventually settling in the Brethil.\n\nIn FA 455, after the Dagor Bragollach, Caranthir was forced to flee\nThargelion and headed south with his brother Amrod. Two years later, the\nsons of Ulfang, Uldor, Ulfast and Ulwarth swore allegiance to\nCaranthir but were faithless later in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nCaranthir, along with his brothers Celegorm and Curufin, perished during\nthe Second Kinslaying in Menegroth to recover the Silmarils from Elven\nKing Dior of Doriath.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nCARANTHIR is the Sindarin translation of his mother-name CARNISTIR\n(“Red-face”) from the Quenya _carnë_ (“red, scarlet”).

His first love was the sea, and he was\nalready a great explorer before he became king. He made several journeys\nto Middle-earth and established contact with Gil-galad in his realm in\nthe Grey Havens making friendship and alliance with him.

She was the second child and\nonly daughter of Boromir and the sister of Bregor her elder brother and\nBeril her younger brother.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nAndreth was born in Ladros in Dorthonion. She was wise in thought and\nlearned in the lore of Men and thus was called '''Saelind\n_'(_Wise-heart) ''by the Elves of her time. In her earlier life she\nlived in the house of Belemir in Ladros, where she had learned the lore\nof the House of Marach from Adanel.\n\nAndreth was deeply in love with Aegnor, son of Finarfin. The love was\nreturned but never fulfilled, since Aegnor departed from motives of\nwisdom as he felt his coming death, thus they never married and had no\nchildren. She had a close friendship with Aegnor's brother Finrod\nFelagund, who often visited her during the Siege of Angband to converse\nand debate with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such\nconversation was written down and later known as _ATHRABETH FINROD AH\nANDRETH_, where she and Finrod discussed differences between Elves and\nMen.\n\n\n\nShe probably died when Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in Dagor\nBragollach in FA 455 of causes unknown. She was the only known person\nof Mankind to have had a romantic relationship with someone of Elvenkind\nbefore Beren.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Andreth_ was a Sindarin word that meant “patience”. The first\nelement of her name may have come from the word _and_, meaning “long”,\npossibly alluding to a meaning such as “long lasting”, although the\nsecond element _reth_ is more difficult to decipher and appears to have\nno immediate explanation.\n\nAs said, Andreth was also known as SAELIND, meaning “wise heart”,\nwhich comes from the Sindarin words SAEL, meaning 'wise', and IND,\nmeaning “inner thought” or “heart”.\n\n\nOther accounts\n\nAndreth had once prophesied that Túrin would return from the dead in the\nlast days to fight in the Last Battle against Morgoth and the dark\nforces.\n\nEarlier names\n\n''Saelon ''and _Saelin_ were two names Tolkien came up with that\npreceded _Saelind_.",

Celegorm, bound to his oath came to Middle-earth and established\ngreat realms in exile and joined with their relatives in the House of\nFingolfin, and waged war against the armies of Morgoth. Celegorm\nand his brother were great lords in the land of Himlad. They were\ndefeated and overwhelmed by the successful sudden assault of Morgoth\nduring the Dagor Bragollach. Celegorm and Curufin lost Himlad and fled\nsouth to the marches of Doriath. Not being welcome there due to the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, Celegorm, Curufin, and their people settled in\nNargothrond.\n\nWhile he and his brother lived in Nargothrond, they captured Lúthien\nTinúviel, daughter of King Thingol of Doriath. Celegorm wished to marry\nher, thus forcing a bond of kinship with Thingol. Huan, however, broke\nwith his master and helped Lúthien escape, foiling his scheme.\nAfterwards, he and his brother were expelled from Nargothrond.\nCelegorm fell at Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying when the Sons of\nFëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of King\nDior of Doriath. Dior and Celegorm slew each other in the halls of\nMenegroth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was TURCAFINWË (“Strong  Finwë). His\nmother-name was TYELKORMO (”Hasty-riser“), from the Quenya word _tyelka_\n(”hasty\"), possibly in references to his quick temper and habit of\nleaping when angered.\n\n\nGallery",

Her father was Dírhael and her mother was\nIvorwen. She was also known as GILRAEN THE FAIR. Gilraen married\nArathorn son of Arador in TA 2929. Her father Dírhael was opposed to the\nmatch because he felt Gilraen was too young to marry and because he had\na sense of foreboding that Arathorn would not live long. But Ivorwen\ncounseled her husband to acquiesce, saying “If these two wed now, hope\nmay be born for our people; but if they delay, it will not come while\nthis age lasts.”\n\nOne year later, Arathorn II became Chieftain of the Dúnedain when his\nfather was killed by Hill-trolls. Gilraen gave birth to Aragorn on March\n1, 2931. In TA 2933, Arathorn was slain by an Orc arrow. Gilraen took\nher two-year-old son Aragorn to Rivendell where Elrond accepted the boy\nas a foster-son and gave him the name Estel, meaning “Hope.”\n\n[Aragorn visiting his mother's grave]\n\nGilraen and Aragorn lived together at Rivendell until TA 2951, when\nAragorn turned twenty and was told of his heritage by Elrond. At that\ntime also Aragorn met Elrond's daughter Arwen and fell in love with her.\nGilraen noticed a change in her son and questioned him about it. She\nwarned Aragorn that Elrond would not easily consent to a marriage\nbetween his only daughter and a mortal Man. Gilraen feared that the line\nof Isildur would end, and she told Aragorn that it was his fate to\nwander in the Wild. She said no more to him of her fears and Aragorn\nleft Rivendell to face many perils and hardships.\n\nAragorn and Arwen plighted their troth in TA 2980. A few years later,\nGilraen left Rivendell and went to live alone near her people in\nEriador. She did not often see her son for he continued to journey\nthroughout Middle-earth. When Aragorn came to visit his mother, she\nforetold her coming death.\n\nGilraen died before the next spring in TA 3007. Her son Aragorn\nfulfilled the Rangers' lifelong goal of restoring the Kingdom of the\nDúnedain when he became King of the Reunited Kingdom on May 1, 3019.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Gilraen_ means 'Wandering star' in Sindarin.",

Beorn's\nkin once inhabited the North of the Anduin valley between the Misty\nMountains and Mirkwood during the last centuries of the Third Age. They\nguarded the Ford of Carrock from the Goblins and Wargs.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\nBeorn was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great\nblack bear. In human form, he appeared as a, tall, black-haired man with\nhuge arms and a great beard. Beorn kept many animals at his residence,\nsuch as horses, dogs and sheep. His animals were all extremely\nintelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while\ncarrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak.\nBeorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was\nalso capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could\ncommunicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded\nlike “barks twisted into some form of speech”.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nIn the years following the Battle of Five Armies, Beorn became a great\nchieftain among the folk of the Anduin Vales and his followers became\nknown as the Beornings. At some point he took a wife and sired a son,\nGrimbeorn, later known as Grimbeorn the Old. Before the War of the Ring,\nBeorn passed away, and his son Grimbeorn eventually took over his\nduties as chieftain. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _BEORN_ originates from an Old English term that means\n“warrior” . It is a cognate to the Old Norse _bjǫrn_ which means\n“bear”.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nDespite being incredibly powerful, Beorn respects all life forms, with\nthe absolute exception of Goblins and Wargs. He has a magic-like effect\non his animals, who seemed to be more intelligent and strong than other\nanimals. He keeps bee pastures and spends his nights patrolling the\nwoods and mountains in the form of a bear. He is wise, mysterious and\npowerful, possessing incredible strength and durability. He is fairly\ndecent, as he allows Thorin and Company to stay at his home for a short\nwhile and even offers them sanctuary from the Goblins. He is also\nvengeful. When Thorin is fatally wounded, he storms the Goblin ranks,\nrescues Thorin and then returns, destroying the Goblins and killing Bolg\nhimself.",

Biography After\nEärendil made his journey to Valinor to convince the Valar to overthrow\nMorgoth and rescue the overmatched and defeated Elves and Edain, The\nHost of Valinor made war upon Morgoth and destroyed his armies. Facing\nfinal defeat, Morgoth unleashed his last and greatest weapon; a fleet of\nwinged fire drakes, led by Ancalagon. So terrible was their onslaught\nthat the armies of the Valar were driven back from the gates of Angband,\nand their coming was said to have been accompanied by a tempest of fire\nand lightning. But Eärendil came out of the West in his blessed ship\nVingilot, accompanied by the Eagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. The\nEagles and Eärendil dueled with Ancalagon and the other Dragons for an\nentire day. Eventually, Eärendil was victorious, casting Ancalagon down\nupon Thangorodrim and destroying the volcanic mountains in his fall. The\ndeath of Ancalagon marked the end of Morgoth's final resistance. Later\nmentions Gandalf spoke of him as he told Frodo the true origin of his\nRing. “It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the\nRings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which\nthe old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even\nAncalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling\nRing, for that was made by Sauron himself.” Etymology The name\n_Ancalagon_ is Sindarin, meaning “Rushing Jaws” from _anca_ (“jaws”) and\nthe root _alak-_ (“rushing”). Other Names The Middle English translation\nfor _Ancalagon_ is ANDRACCA, from _and-_ (“opposition”), _anda_\n(“hatred, envy”), and _draca_ (“dragon”). Character Ancalagon's size is\nnot specified, but must have been colossal due to the destruction of\n“the towers of Thangorodrim”, which are elsewhere identified with the\nthree smoking peaks of the mountain. He was however, said to be as big\nas a mountain. However, his size is never directly specified and some\npowerful but small creatures are able to cause great destruction even in\ndeath, such as Durin's Bane breaking the slopes of Celebdil.

Thus, it was he who discovered the Elves when they first awoke\nat Cuivienen and named them the _Eldar_ . Thereafter he remained close\nin friendship with them. A powerful huntsman, he was active in the\nstruggles against Morgoth. He had a great horn called the Valaróma and a\ngreat steed named Nahar. Huan, a Hound from Valinor, once belonged to\nhim but was later given to Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor.\nEtymology _OROMË_ means “Horn-blowing” and “Sound of Horns”, and is\nderived from the Valarin name ARÔMÊZ. _ARAW_ is the Sindarin translation\nof Oromë. The Sindar additionally referred to him as _TAURON_, which\nmeans “Lord of the Forests” and “The Forester.” It is possible that the\nname comes from the Sindarin _taur_ (“forest”) or the Quenyan _taure_\n(“great wood”).

Biography The Great Goblin was a Goblin chieftain of the Misty\nMountains. He was a very large creature with a huge head. He was the\nchief of a group of goblins who lived in Goblin-town near the High Pass.\nThey preyed on travellers who used another, easier pass near the main\ngate of Goblin-town until people started avoiding that route over the\nmountains. The goblins then made another gate that opened into a cave\nthat they called the Front Porch, at the top of the High Pass. The Great\nGoblin also sometimes ordered his goblins to catch fish for him in\nGollum's Lake, and these goblins were sometimes killed by Gollum. In the\nsummer of TA 2941, the Dwarves of Thorin and Company, along with Bilbo\nBaggins, were captured on the Front Porch and were brought before the\nGreat Goblin in his great cave, where he was seated on a flat stone and\nsurrounded by armed guards. The Great Goblin demanded to know what the\nDwarves were doing in the mountains. (He seems less hostile in this\npassage than the Orcs are during the later War of the Ring, as his\nquestioning seems to imply that he has not decided beforehand whether he\nwill order the party killed, make them slaves, or even let them go, but\nthat he will decide according to their answers. It is also possible he\nwas just toying with the group and would kill them afterwards.) When it\nwas revealed that Thorin carried the Elvish sword Orcrist - which the\nOrcs and goblins fear and which they called “Biter” - the Great Goblin\nwas enraged and at once leapt to attack Thorin. Immediately, all the\ntorches in the cave were extinguished and a glowing sword “bright as\nblue flame” appeared. It was Glamdring, called “Beater” by the goblins,\nand now wielded by Gandalf. As the Dwarves were escaping, the Great\nGoblin leapt down in front of them, and attacked Gandalf who was at the\nhead of the party. Gandalf then fought back, stabbing the Great Goblin\nand killing him. The death of the Great Goblin angered the goblins of\nthe Misty Mountains. A great army of goblins and Wargs was amassed by\nBolg, whose father Azog had been killed by the dwarf Dáin II Ironfoot.\nBolg's forces tracked Thorin and Company to the Lonely Mountain where\nthey fought in the Battle of the Five Armies against the Dwarves, Elves,\nand Lakemen.",

During the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Amrod and his\nbrothers swore the Oath of Fëanor. Before they left for Middle-earth,\nNerdanel Amrod's mother begged Fëanor to leave her two youngest son with\nhim or at least one of them.

She was known as _VÁNA THE EVER-YOUNG_. \nBiography Vána was the younger sister of Yavanna (_Queen of the Earth_)\nand the wife of Oromë (_Huntsman of the Valar_). In Vána's dwellings she\nhad gardens filled with golden flowers; and often, Vána came to the\nforests of Oromë. Like her sister, the province of Vána was growing\nthings of the world and she was a lover of nature. Vána had influence\nwith the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, and she was associated\nespecially with flowers thus Vána was also known as the “Queen of\nFlowers”. It was said that when the Valar Tulkas & Nessa were wedded on\nthe Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the Valar, Vána robed her\nsister-in-law _Nessa the Swift_ (sister of Oromë) with her flowers. In\nthe Days of the Two Trees of Valinor, Arien of the Maiar, before she\ncame to carry the vessel of the Sun, had served Vána by tending to the\ngolden flowers of Vána's gardens watering them with bright dews from the\ngreat golden Tree Laurelin. Melian also was another Maia who initially\nserved Vána before she departed for Middle-earth. After the Darkening of\nValinor and the flight of the Noldor to Middle-Earth, most of the Valar\nwere glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing neither the rumors\nof Melkor and his violence nor the murmur of the restless Noldor to come\nupon them again. Thus for such reasons, they clamored for the\nconcealment of their land Aman. It was said that Vána was one among\nthem. Character According to _The Silmarillion_, “All flowers spring as\nVána passes and opens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at\nher coming.” Vána robed herself in flowers and it was said that her hair\nwas golden in color. Vána had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon\nher face and in all her works. Like Nessa, Vána also sang and danced\nalong with her maidens. The Maiar of Vána - Arien, the Maia who guided\nthe Sun, was one of her Maiar in Valinor. - Melian, who later in\nMiddle-earth became Queen of Doriath by marrying the Elf-King Thingol.\nEtymology The name _VÁNA_ may have been derived from the Quenya word\n_vanima_ (“beautiful”), as she is often described as “fair”. Hence she\nwas also known as _VÁNA THE FAIR_.",

Bergil had an uncle named Iorlas,\nwho was the same age as Pippin. It is not certain whether Iorlas was the\nbrother of Beregond or of Bergil's mother, although Iorlas does not\nfollow the alliterative pattern evident in males known to be related to\nBeregond (_Bergil, Borlas_).\n\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in TA 3009, Bergil was nine years old at the time when the War of\nthe Ring began. He is one of the few children that remained in Minas\nTirith during that when the forces of Mordor were preparing to lay siege\non the city. He guides Peregrin Took throughout the city when he and\nGandalf arrived, and they became very good friends in the process.\nBefore the armies of Mordor were about to lay siege, Bergil and Pippin\nwitnessed the arrival of several armies from other parts of Gondor to\ndefend the city. During the siege of Minas Tirith, Bergil helped the\nhealers of the city as an errand runner and so eventually contributed to\nthe healing of Faramir, the Steward's son and later Prince of Ithilien.\n\nBergil who, running errands for the healers of Minas Tirith, told\nGandalf where Pippin and the injured Meriadoc Brandybuck were; Merry,\nsuffering from the Black Breath, had gotten lost during the battle over\nthe fields of Pelennor. He was also the one who brought the Athelas\nleaves to Aragorn; at that time, he showed his love for Faramir by\nbursting into tears. Bergil also kept Merry company while the Captains\nof the West led their men off to the Black Gate and then escorted him\nback to the Houses of Healing.\n\nOf Bergil's destiny the novel or its appendices tell nothing. It is\nprobable that he went with his father into Ithilien after the War of the\nRing was over. His younger brother Borlas was central to “The New\nShadow”, the soon-abandoned draft for a _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nBergil is one of the few children in The Lord of the Rings who is\naffected by the course of war. By refusing to leave the endangered city,\nhe, like many other characters in the novel, turns into an “unlikely\nhero” and “courageously serves his 'master' and his country in ways\nunanticipated by his father, Beregond”. His friendship and loyalty to\nPeregrin Took contributes greatly to establishing the latter's affinity\nto Gondor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Bergil_ means “Valiant star” from _ber_ (“valiant”) and _gil_ (“star”).",

Húrin was left with a small garrison of men from the city in\norder to defend it should Sauron decided to bring more Haradrim up out\nof the south and assult it while the other captains rode towards Mordor.\nHúrin was aided in his defence of the city by Elfhelm, a marshal of\nRohan and some two thousand men of Rohan. Their numbers were further\nbolstered by a great number of men that arrived out of Gondor's southern\nlands, led by Angbor the Fearless, who was the Lord of Lamedon.

After this battle, the Easterlings settled in the\nland and oppressed the people of Hador.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nNienor remained in Hithlum with her mother Morwen for twenty years,\nsubsequently moving to Doriath in hopes of finding Túrin, who has been\nsent there earlier. After she and her mother heard a rumour that the\nmysterious Mormegil of Nargothrond was actually Túrin, they set out with\na company of Elves for that place. Unfortunately, the dragon Glaurung\nhad just sacked that Elven city, and, sensing their approach, he caused\na cloud of foul vapor to rise from the Narog. The party's horses\npanicked and Niënor was separated, at which point the worm Glaurung used\nhis famous abilities to put her in a state of total amnesia.\n\n\n\nEventually, the amnesiac woman was found by Mablung, who intended to\ntake her back to Doriath but they were attacked by orcs while attempting\nto cross the Taeglin. In confusion and terror, Niënor ran away, tore off\nher clothes and ran naked through the forest until she fainted.\n\nHer brother Túrin found her, naked and terrified, at Haudh-en-Elleth,\nlying on the grave of his dead lover Finduilas. Because Niënor did not\nremember her identity and Túrin did not know his sister, as he had never\nseen her before, he named her _Níniel_ which means “Tear-Maiden”, and\nbrought her to safety at Brethil.\n\n The men of Brethil\nreturned to Ephel Brandir soon after. When “Níniel” fell sick, Brandir\ntended to her, secretly falling in love. However, “Níniel” loved Túrin\nmore, and after three years, they were wed. By the next spring, she was\nhalfway through her first pregnancy.\n\nIt was then that rumours of Glaurung's approach reached Túrin, who went\nout to slay him. Unfortunately, the dragon envenomed him even as he\ndealt the worm a mortal blow, and Túrin fell into a swoon.\n\nAt this unfortunate moment, “Níniel”, who feared for her husband's life,\nwent out and found him apparently dead.

Her death sparked a series of events culminating in his\nsuicide, thus fulfilling Glaurung's vengeance.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NIËNOR_ means “mourning” and _NÍNIEL_ means “tear-maiden” in\nSindarin.",

After years of\nwandering westwards in search of the High Elves (or the Valar, of whom\nthe Bëorians had heard rumor from the lesser elves they had met in the\neast), Bëor was eager to establish good relations with Felagund, and the\ntwo strove to understand each other. The language barrier was not a\nmajor problem due to the similarities between the tongue of the\nBëorians, which had been influenced by the elves they had met earlier,\nand the Sindarin tongue. In the tongue of his people, called Taliska,\nBëor was named 'Balan'. The name he is more commonly called by, Bëor was\nactually the Taliska word for 'vassal', which he earned in the service\nof Felagund.\n\n\n\nBëor and his people settled first in Ossiriand, but were at odds with\nthe Green-elves that already dwelt there, for the men competed with the\nelves for food and natural resources. Therefore, on the advice of\nFelagund, Bëor led his people to Estolad, the encampment, in the realm\nof Amrod and Amras, sons of Fëanor. There the people of the first house\nbecame more numerous and were enriched by the teachings of the Eldar.\nBëor, however, was not content and wanted to leave Estolad and enter\ninstead into the service of King Felagund. He committed the rule of his\npeople to Baran, his son, and departed with Felagund to his realm of\nNargothrond. There Bëor continued his service with Felagund, and he\nreturned never to Estolad. He died in the year 355 of the First Age at\nthe age ninety-three, having spent 44 years in the service of Felagund.\nHis death was greatly lamented by King Finrod and his people, who\nwitnessed for the first time the Gift of Men: death.

Daeron was a brilliant loremaster and was the\ngreatest musician in Middle-earth. Second to him was Maglor, one of\nFeanor's sons. Biography Daeron was born in Middle-earth at some\nundetermined time. Following the folk of Elwë, he became an important\nelf close to King Thingol, serving as his loremaster and minstrel. He\ndevised the Cirth (familiarly known as Runes), which would later become\nan important writing form. Daeron and Mablung both attended the Mereth\nAderthad to bear greetings from their King. He loved Thingol's daughter,\nLúthien, more than anything, devising music in her honor and often\nplayed it while she danced. However, she did not return his affections.\nTwenty years after the Return of the Ñoldor, he attended the Mereth\nAderthad with his kinsman Mablung bearing gifts and greetings to the\nÑoldor from the King of Doriath. Hundreds of years later when Beren came\nto Doriath, Lúthien and Beren fell in love, though they kept it secret\nfrom Thingol, knowing he would not approve of his daughter promising\nherself to a mortal. However, Daeron's jealousy of their love for each\nother caused him to spy on them both and report what he saw and heard to\nThingol. Later, when Lúthien learned that Sauron had imprisoned Beren,\nshe sought Daeron's counsel but he betrayed her to the king, causing her\nto be imprisoned in Hírilorn. After she had escaped and went away to\nfind Beren and was feared to be lost, Daeron repented his previous deeds\nand left Doriath to search for her in vain. He lost his way somewhere in\nthe far East of Middle-earth, where he dwelt in dark places lamenting\nhis love for Lúthien. His fate or whereabouts afterwards in the world\nare not known. Legacy His invention of the Cirth provided an alphabet of\nrunes that the Dwarves adopted in their writings and spread throughout\nMiddle-earth, passing them down from age to age. These runes would later\nbecome the script used in Moria and were known as Daeron's Runes.\nEtymology His name is derived from the Sindarin word _daer_ (“large,\ngreat”). In earlier etymologies of the legendarium the Doriathrin name\nis given as _DAIRON_, of which the root was the Doriathrin word\nfor shadow, _dai_.

Haldir could speak it fluently, as he often\ntravelled outside of Lothlórien. Little is known about his brothers.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nOn January 15, 3019, the brothers encountered the Fellowship near the\nNimrodel in the eaves of the forest. Haldir was able to speak to the\nFellowship, for he knew the Common Tongue. Haldir welcomed Legolas as\none of his kindred from the north and recognized Aragorn as a friend to\nLady Galadriel. He was prepared to lead the Fellowship into Lórien, but\nhe hesitated upon learning that one of the party was a Dwarf. After\nconsulting with his brothers, Haldir agreed that Gimli could enter if he\nwent blindfolded. The fellowship then insisted that if one of them had\nto go blindfolded, they all would. The brothers reluctantly agreed, and\nthen led them into the forest.\n\nThey spent the night on a Flet, or a platform in the trees. During the\nnight, Haldir and his brothers heard Orcs passing and lured them away\nfrom the Fellowship. When he returned to the flet, Haldir saw a strange\ncreature at the base of the tree, which Frodo guessed to be Gollum.\n\nIn the morning, Haldir fashioned a rope bridge for the Fellowship to use\nto cross the Silverlode. Haldir learned from Merry Brandybuck that the\nGrey Havens lay west of the Shire, and he spoke longingly of the sea,\nbut sadly of the time when he and his kin would have to leave Lorien.\nWhen news came that the Fellowship's blindfolds could be removed, Haldir\napologized to Gimli and welcomed him as the first Dwarf to enter Lórien\nsince the time of Durin.\n\nAfter guiding the Fellowship to Caras Galadhon, Haldir returned to his\nduties guarding the northern borders, but he returned when the\nFellowship was about to depart to guide them to the banks of the\nSilverlode, where boats awaited them.\n\nNothing further is known of Haldir's activities.

    "text": "ELWING, also known as ELWING THE WHITE, was the daughter of Dior the\nFair and his wife Nimloth. She was the younger sister of the twin\nbrothers Eluréd and Elurín. She became the wife of Eärendil the Mariner,\nand was the mother of Elrond and Elros. Biography Elwing, as well as her\nbrothers, were born in a house near Lanthir Lamath and lived there until\nher father went to Doriath to assume his inheritance as King of Doriath.\nWhen the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family\nwas either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as\nwell as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of\nSirion. It was at the Havens that Elwing met Eärendil and later married\nhim. She bore him twin sons, Elrond and Elros. Elrond later went on to\nmarry Lady Celebrian, daughter of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel of\nLothlórien. From this marriage they produced three children, Elladan and\nElrohir, twin brothers, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor.\nThese children were therefore Elwing's grandchildren, a privilege shared\nwith the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien. In the present matter at hand,\nElwing was forced to abandon her children when the Sons of Fëanor came\nfor the Silmaril in Elwing's possession. Rather than give it over, she\nthrew herself into the Sea and was transformed into a great white bird.\nShe flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the\nVingilot. Then, on behalf of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth, they\nchose to sail for Valinor in the faint hope that they could make a final\nplea on behalf of those who suffered under Morgoth. When they arrived,\nElwing chose to accompany her husband onto the shores, even though she\nknew it might mean her death. While Eärendil journeyed to visit the\nValar, Elwing walked the shores, eventually meeting the Elves of\nAlqualondë. There, she told them the tale of what was happening in\nMiddle-earth and became much loved by them. The Valar eventually agreed\nto go to war to aid those in Middle-earth, and also decided to give both\nEärendil and Elwing the choice of which kindred they would belong.\nEärendil, out of respect for his wife, allowed her to choose for the\nboth of them. She chose to be counted among the elves, in honor of her\nforemother, Lúthien. A white tower was later built for Elwing where she\ncould live. It was also said that the birds taught her their language\nand that she would fly to meet Eärendil when he returned from his\nnightly voyages. Etymology The name ELWING means “Star-foam”, from the\nSindarin _el_ (“star”) and _wing_ (“foam, spray”). Gallery",

She lived with her mother\nGaladriel in Eregion, and later fled to Lórinand sometime between SA\n1350 and SA 1400. After a time, Galadriel and Celebrían passed through\nMoria and dwelt in Rivendell. There, she met Elrond who loved her,\nthough he said nothing about it.\n\nIn TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. She bore him twin sons, Elladan and\nElrohir in TA 130, and then a daughter, Arwen in TA 241.\n\nIn TA 2509, Celebrían was on her way to visit her parents in Lothlórien\nwhen she was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass of the Misty Mountains.\nShe was then tormented by the orcs and received a poisoned wound. Her\nsons arrived much later to rescue her, and Elrond to heal her, but\nCelebrían was never fully-healed in mind and spirit. Horrified and\nhaunted by the fearful memories of her torture, she no longer desired to\nremain on Middle-earth, and sailed west the next year in the TA 2510.\n\n\nLater mentions\n\nThere are several references of Celebrían in _The Lord of the Rings_,\nsuch as the mention of her torment and being the daughter of\nGaladriel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name CELEBRÍAN means “Silver queen”, from the Sindarin words\n_celeb_ (“silver”) and _rían_ (“queen”).\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier writings, Amroth the King of Lothlórien was the son of\nCeleborn and Galadriel, and the brother of Celebrían. It was said that\nGaladriel fled with Amroth and Celebrían to Lothlórien. When Galadriel\nand Celebrían left for Rivendell, Amroth was left in the forest, and\nwould later visit his family when they lived in Dol Amroth.\n\nIn other versions, Celebrían wedded Elrond in TA 2500, but in TA 2600,\nshe was slain (not captured) by the Orcs in the Misty Mountains. Her\nchildren were Elladan and Elrohir, and Finduilas (later Arwen).\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nTolkien has said that “after the destruction of the Ruling Ring the\nThree Rings of the Eldar lost their virtue. Then Elrond prepared at last\nto depart from Middle-earth and follow Celebrían.” Thus it passed\nthat after 500 long years, at the Haven of Avallonë in Tol Eressëa,\nElrond and Celebrían were finally reunited, sometime after TA 3021 (the\nRing-bearer sailing on September 29, 3021). However, Elrond was then\n“sundered” forever from his beloved daughter.\n\nBjörn Fromén has composed an evocative poem, Celebrían's Farewell to\nElrond, _Valinórenna_.",

He is the brother of\nBalin and the youngest son of Fundin.\n\nTall, moody, strong and very brave, Dwalin is a Dwarf through and\nthrough. A famous warrior, powerful ally and muscular, Dwalin would like\nnothing more than to see the return of the Dwarven King under the\nMountain.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had come to Erebor and\ntook over the Kingdom, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother\nof Balin (though he is taller). After fighting in the Battle of\nAzanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second and\nThorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin\n\nLater in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others\naccompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small\nparty was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was\ncaptured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves\nof Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their\nleader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the\nnews.\n\nQuest of Erebor\n\nDwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the\nunexpected party began at Bilbo's hobbit hole. He was wearing a\ndark-green hood and walked in as if expected, which greatly surprised\nBilbo. Soon Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept\nanswering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when\nBilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out\nrefreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and\nKíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with\nmusic, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself. Dwalin lent a green\nhood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out on their journey.\n\nAfter reclaiming the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought in the Battle of\nFive Armies and was one of those that survived the terrible battle. He\nlater received his fourteenth share and chose to live in Erebor under\nthe rule of Dáin II Ironfoot, Thorin's cousin.\n\nLater life\n\nDwalin was one of seven of the ten Dwarves of Thorin's company who were\nstill living in Erebor when Frodo came to Rivendell, as reported by\nGlóin. After the War of the Ring was over, resulting the defeat of\nSauron and the destruction of the One Ring, Dwalin lived throughout his\nlife in the Fourth Age in Middle-earth and passed away in FO 91 at the\nage of 340, considered later than any other known date of death for\nothers of the company.",

After the War of Wrath, he\ndeclined to depart Middle-earth as many others did, and instead went\nover the Blue Mountains with his household. He eventually ended up in\nGreenwood the Great, where Silvan Elves of Nandorin descent lived, and\nhe was taken by them as lord. His capital was at Amon Lanc.\n\nWest of Oropher's realm was the realm of Lórinand across the Anduin,\nwhere Amdír, another Sindar, ruled over Silvan Elves. When Sauron\nreturned to Middle-earth from the Downfall of Númenor and began to grow\nin power, Oropher's folk retreated north of the old Dwarf-Road, and\nlater again north of the Mountains of Mirkwood, where they fortified\nthemselves.\n\nWar of Last Alliance\n\nBefore the War of the Last Alliance, Oropher and his folk left their\ncapital at Amon Lanc and crossed Anduin to live with their kin in\nLórinand. For another three times, he moved his people northward to Emyn\nDuir, the Mountains of Mirkwood. His retreat northwards was because of\nhis desire to move “out of range” from the Dwarves of Khazad-dum.\n\nThough he and his people had little to do with the other peoples of\nMiddle-earth, Oropher understood that there could be no lasting peace\nuntil Sauron was defeated. Oropher answered the summons for the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men but marched as an independent army with Amdír,\nor Malgalad the then King of Lórien. He joined with Gil-galad's forces\nas they marched down the Anduin to Dagorlad. Oropher's company was\nlightly armed.\n\nIn the Battle of Dagorlad, Oropher's company fought valiantly but he was\nslain with the greater part of his people when he, with King Amdír and\nhis warriors, called an early charge upon the enemy, without orders from\nthe Noldorin High-King Gil-galad. After Sauron was defeated, Thranduil,\nOropher's son and heir, returned to Eryn Galen with the shattered\nremnants of the formerly grand army of his people, back north. Ever\nafter it distressed Thranduil to even turn his gaze south to the\ndirection, and memory, of the horrors of the War of the Last Alliance,\nin which his beloved father fell with many of their people.\nNevertheless, while depleted, their army was still large enough that the\norcs hiding in secret in the Misty Mountains did not dare attack\nthem.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Oropher_ probably means “Tall beech-tree” from _oro_ (“up,\nrise, high”). In Doriath, the term _orn_ refers to trees, especially\nbeeches. The terms _pher_ or _pheren_ both mean “beech-tree”.",

Uniquely among the\nÑoldor, he and his descendants all had golden hair inherited from his\nVanyarin mother Indis, thus his house was sometimes called “_The Golden\nHouse of Finarfin_”.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFinarfin was the youngest child and third son of Finwë, High-King of the\nNoldor in Aman, with his second wife Indis of the Vanyar. His elder\nsiblings were _Findis_, Fingolfin, and ''Írimë ''while his elder\nhalf-brother was the infamous Noldorin High-prince Fëanor who was the\neldest son of Finarfin's father Finwë, In YT 1280, Finarfin married\nEärwen, a princess of the Teleri being the daughter of Olwë, King of the\nTeleri, which made him thus related to the kin of Thingol (Elwë), King\nof Doriath who was the brother of Olwë. Together, they had four (five)\nchildren: Finrod Felagund, Orodreth (according to the published\n_Silmarillion_) Angrod, Aegnor, and an only daughter Galadriel who was\nthe youngest child.\n\nAfter the death of Finwë, when Fëanor gave his wrathful speech before\nthe Ñoldor of Tirion, Finarfin was there, and listening to the hasty\nwords, he tried in vain to persuade the Ñoldor to pause and not to be\nrash. Nevertheless he departed with his brothers Fëanor and Fingolfin\nfor Middle-earth, but turned back when Mandos pronounced the Doom of the\nÑoldor. Finarfin and his people were pardoned by the Valar, and then\nhe became King of the residual Ñoldor in Aman and presumably still rules\nfrom Tirion on Túna.\n\nDuring the War of Wrath, Finarfin led a large battalion of the Valar,\ncomprised of Ñoldorin, Vanyarin, and Telerin Elves.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name is ARAFINWË, the “Noble-Finwë”, from the Quenya _ara_\n(“noble, high, royal”). His amilessë (mother-name) is\nINGOLDO (“the Ñoldo”).\n\nOther names\n\nAn Old English translation for his name was FINRED FELANOP, in which\n“Felanop” means “very bold”.\n\n\nDescendants\n\nThrough Galadriel, he is the grandfather of Lady Celebrian of Rivendell\n(wife of Elrond), and consequently, the great-grandfather of her three\nchildren Elladan and Elrohir, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of\nGondor.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the early versions of the legendarium, Finarfin was referred as\n“Finrod” his son Finrod Felagund was “Inglor Felagund”. As such, he\nappears in the first edition of _The Lord of the Rings_ as Finrod. This\nwas changed in later editions, but not all references to Inglor were\nremoved.

She married Húrin of the House of Marach. After Dagor\nBragollach, she and her folk moved northeast through the Ered Wethrin\nand after enduring great losses and finally came to Dor-lómin in Hithlum\nand were well received by the folk there. It was here that she and her\nhusband had their three children, Túrin, Niënor Níniel, and Lalaith.\n\n\n\nHúrin went off to fight in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad but never returned as\nthe battle was lost. After the defeat of the Union of Maedhros, the\nsavage Easterlings came to Hithlum to claim their new land as a reward\nfor fighting for the Dark Lord. The Easterlings were cruel and took many\nslaves including the young and old. Morwen resisted the new Easterling\nlords that took over Húrin's land, and sent Túrin away to Doriath and\nthe court of King Thingol, to prevent him from being taken as a slave.\nHowever, none of the Easterlings dared take Morwen's home, for they\nbelieved she was a witch and in league with elves, although she had no\nsuch power. After most of the danger had passed, she went to Doriath\nlooking for Túrin. Niënor followed her against her commands, but she was\naccepted by Thingol.\n\nMorwen was alarmed at not finding her son in Doriath, and after staying\nfor a while she and Mablung left to search for Túrin. Niënor followed\nagainst Morwen's will for a second time. While they sought for Túrin in\nthe forest, Glaurung the dragon came upon them. He gave Niënor amnesia\nwith his dragon magic and left. When Mablung found Niënor, she ran off\ninto the woods, and was not seen by Morwen again. Morwen returned to\nDoriath after this sad incident.\n\n\n\nMorwen met her husband Húrin once again after the death of Túrin and\nNiënor.

In TA\n2976, he married Finduilas of Dol Amroth, daughter of Prince Adrahil II\nof Dol Amroth. Together, the couple had two sons, Boromir and\nFaramir. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died, leaving Denethor\nbitter.\n\nHe succeeded his father Ecthelion II as the twenty-sixth Ruling Steward\nin TA 2984. During his stewardship, Gandalf was less welcome in Minas\nTirith and his counsels went unheeded.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nDenethor secretly used a Palantír to probe Sauron's strength, and he\nused it at the top of the White Tower in his secret chamber, above the\nThrone room. The effort aged him quickly, and the knowledge of\nSauron's overwhelming force exacerbated the bitterness that had taken\nroot at the time of the death of his wife, Finduilas, in TA 2988. Sauron\nused the Palantír to drive him mad with despair. He retained, however,\nan air of nobility and power. The death of Boromir, his eldest son and\nfavorite, and the siege and apparent doom of the capital city drove\nDenethor further along the path to madness. Following this, he became\nestranged from Faramir. Shockingly, Faramir still upheld his father's\nwishes.\n\nHis actions, however, did not immediately proclaim his insanity. The\nOsgiliath mission was not obviously suicidal, as the city had not yet\nbeen overrun. The Warning beacons of Gondor had indeed been lit,\nalthough Denethor expected little help, because of the fatalistic\nmindset that he had at that time of sorrow.\n\nHe committed suicide on March 15, 3019, having ordered his men to erect\na pyre for him and Faramir in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. He threw a\ntorch onto the pyre, then broke the white rod of his office over his\nknee and cast it into the flames, symbolizing the end of his stewardship\nand the end of the rule of the Stewards. He laid himself down on the\ntable and so perished, clasping the Palantíri in his hands. His attempt\nto take the grievously injured and apparently dying Faramir with him was\nthwarted by the timely intervention of Beregond and ultimately, by\nGandalf.\n\nDenethor II ruled as the Steward of Gondor for 35 years, from TA 2984\nuntil his death on TA 3019. The title of the Ruling Steward was passed\nto his son, Faramir, who also became the first of the Princes of\nIthilien.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nDENETHOR might have been named after the tenth Ruling Steward of Gondor,\nwho, in turn, was named after a Nandorin Elf. The name comes from the\nNandorin words _dene_ (“strong, lithe”) and _thara_ (“tall, slender”),\nand gives the name a meaning of “Lithe and lank”.",

During his time the Númenóreans began to return to\nMiddle-earth, and great fleets of ships were built to explore all the\nlands east of Númenor.\n\n\nBiography\n\nTar-Meneldur succeeded his father, Tar-Elendil, because the rules of\nsuccession did not allow women to rule, per the principle of agnatic\nprimogeniture. Had the principle of equal primogeniture been followed\ninstead, control of the throne would have passed to Silmariën.\n\nTar-Meneldur married Almarian and had three\nchildren: Tar-Aldarion, Ailinel, and Almiel.\n\nDuring the rule of Tar-Meneldur, contact with the Middle Men of Eriador\nwas reestablished under guidance of the elves of Lindon under Gil-galad.\nTar-Meneldur encouraged the seafarers, and allowed his son Aldarion to\nestablish a guild of seafarers, which became one of the most powerful\norganisations in Númenor. Many voyages along the coasts were made at\nthis time, and the first settlements were made in Middle-earth by\nNúmenórean explorers, although none of them permanent yet. These early\nsettlements were however the later cores of Arnor and Gondor, and the\nreestablished contact of Númenóreans with their distant kin allowed the\nAdûnaic tongue to merge with local, far akin languages, eventually\nleading to the Westron speech. This would in later years prove to be one\nof the greatest assets to the power of Númenor in Middle-earth.\n\nNear the end of Tar-Meneldur's rule reports came that evil had begun to\nstir in the east of Middle-earth (the first awakenings of Sauron, as was\nlater learned), and Gil-galad requested the aid of Tar-Meneldur.\nRecognizing his son Aldarion was more aware of the troubles, and was a\npowerful leader of men, Meneldur abdicated in favour of his son far\nearlier than was expected.\n\nOn the family front Meneldur, together with his wife Almarian, attempted\nto mediate between his son Aldarion and Aldarion's betrothed Erendis,\nwho had become estranged. For a time they were successful, and Aldarion\nand Erendis were wed, but Aldarion soon left again for sea. It was\nduring his long absence in Middle-earth, a time during which Aldarion\nwas instructed by Gil-galad, that Erendis left the royal court for her\nhome. By the time Aldarion returned even Meneldur's best attempts could\nnot heal the breach.\n\nMeneldur was a lover of star-lore and enjoyed watching their motions.\nFor this purpose he built a tower in the north of Forostar.\n\nMeneldur died in SA 942 after a rule of 143 years, at the age of 399\nyears.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nMENELDUR means “Servant of Heaven” in Quenya.\n\nOther Names\n\nHis other names ELENTIRMO meant “the Heavens” and “Star\nWatcher” also in Quenya.",

She had long yellow hair and\nher voice was beautiful, “as young and as ancient as spring, like the\nsong of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning\nin the hills.”\n\nGoldberry hosted the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Meriadoc Brandybuck,\nPeregrin Took, and Samwise Gamgee when Tom Bombadil brought them to his\nhouse after rescuing them from the perils of Old Man Willow in the Old\nForest. They found her to be as mysterious as Tom, but were grateful for\nher kindness to them and were enchanted by her presence. When they first\nsaw her she was wearing a gown “green as young reeds, shot with silver\nlike beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of\nflag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots.” She was\nstanding amid wide vessels of green and brown earthenware in which\n“white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in\nthe midst of a pool.”\n\nAfter rescuing the Hobbits from the Barrow-downs, Tom Bombadil selected\na brooch with blue stones from the hoard of the Barrow-wights to give\nGoldberry.\n\n\nNotes on origin\n\nIn _The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien_, Tolkien describes Goldberry as the\nseasonal changes in nature, and Tom Bombadil as the nature spirit of the\nEnglish countryside.\n\nTolkien based his mythic personages on Eurasian myth and cosmology. The\nGreat Goddess who is mother of all things was, before Time existed, the\nelement of water, undifferentiated. Time begins when her first offspring\nis born, and, according to Tom Bombadil, he is the Eldest, the\nfirstborn. The River is the local manifestation of the primal Great\nGoddess, and Goldberry is her daughter, the spirit of all local waters\nexisting in Time, alive and embodied.\n\nBoth Tom and Goldberry are primal spirits of nature, he of the land and\nits produce and she of the water. In early Eurasian myth, the element\nof water is feminine and the land or earth is masculine; therefore,\nGoldberry represents the female principle of life while Tom represents\nthe male. Together as husband and wife they are the totality of\nprimal Nature, endlessly proceeding in an eternal circle from season to\nseason forever.",

    "text": "CASTAMIR THE USURPER usurped the throne of Gondor from Eldacar, ruling\nfrom TA 1437 to 1447 of the Third Age, until he was violently deposed at\nthe Battle of Erui.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThe great-grandson of the unremarkable King Calmacil, Castamir was not\nin line for the throne, but his royal background had made him the _Lord\nof Ships_ under the previous king, Valacar. His lineage and influence\nleft him in a position to challenge the current king, Eldacar, who was\nonly half Dúnedain. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the\nlegitimate heir to the throne, but his half Rhovanion lineage angered\ncitizens who believed in a pure dúnedain royalty. Capitalizing on what\nbecame outright protest against the current king, Castamir was able to\nincite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the city Osgiliath in TA\n1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops,\ndestroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the\ncity and into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the\nking, Castamir seized the throne.\n\nFor ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar\nquietly regained power. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul\ndeeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the\npeople of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure Númenórean\nblood. Then, in 1447, Castamir, now called “the Usurper” by his people\nwas overthrown after a decade of wicked rule with the people now\nrallying around the true king, Eldacar. He was slain by Eldacar's forces\nat the Battle of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this\nperiod came to be known. At the Crossings of Erui, Eldacar personally\nslew Castamir.\n\nCastamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his\nsurviving sons, retreated from the Battle of Erui to the port of\nPelargir and escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These\ndescendants of Castamir became the so-called “Corsairs of Umbar”, fierce\npirates who terrorized the ports of Gondor with the help of the men of\nHarad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400\nyears, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit\nwas the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by\nhis great-grandsons Angamaitë‎ and Sangahyando‎ sailed up the river\nAnduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid\ncoincided with the young King Minardil's visit, and he was slain in by\nthe Corsairs as they attacked.\n\nThey remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar\nretook Umbar for Gondor. So great a victory was this, that forever after\nTelumehtar was known as Umbardacil, which literally means “victor over\nUmbar”. In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were finally\nkilled.",

He had a strong\nfriendship with the Elves, who were half his kin. Biography First Age In\nFA 532, Elros was born inArvernien. In the assault of the Third\nKinslaying by the Sons of Fëanor, Elros and Elrond were taken captive by\nMaglor and Maedhros. Later, Elwing, their mother, cast herself into the\ngreat Belegaer and vanished from Middle-earth. From then on, Elros and\nhis brother were raised by Maedhros and Maglor. They were both raised in\nlove for neither Maedhros nor Maglor were proud of their deeds. It is\nnowhere told when or if Elros and Elrond actually left Maedhros and\nMaglor but it can be assumed that at the time of Eönwë's arrival they\ntook full part in the war. In FA 547, the host of Eönwë and the Valar\nwere seen shining upon the sea and the noise of Eönwë`s trumpets rang\nover the waves. Eönwë summoned all of the Elves and all of the men from\nHithlum to the South, rallying them for the great war against Melkor\nthat was now to come. Second Age Eventually the War of Wrath ended. As\nElros and Elrond were Peredhil, or Half-elven, and only in these two\nremained the line of heroic chieftains of Men in the First Age. The\nValar gave to Elrond and Elros the choice of which kindred they would\nbelong to. Elros chose to be of Man-kind and as such he was granted a\ngreat life-span. Eonwë came among the faithful humans and he taught them\nand gave them wisdom, power, and a life longer than any others of mortal\nrace, but none of the high men ever reached the age of Elros. And a\ngreat land was made for them; not a part of Middle-earth and not wholly\nseparate from it. This land was Númenor, and Elros was its first king.\nNúmenor was raised from the depths of the sea by Ossë, established by\nAulë and enriched by Yavanna. The Elves brought flowers and fountains\nout of Tol Eressëa from Avallónë and wrought gardens in Númenor. The\nValar called it Andor, The Land of Gift, and its own people called it\nWesternessë, for it lay west of all the lands inhabited by Mortals. When\nElros was 90 years old, he ascended the throne of Númenor in the city of\nArmenelos where he was inscribed as Elros Tar-Minyatur. The sword\nAranrúth which once was his great-great-grandfather Thingol's sword, the\nSerpent Ring, and Dramborleg, the Axe of Tuor became heirlooms of the\nKings of Númenor. During his time as king, Elros had four children to an\nunnamed mortal wife. They included three sons, Vardamir Nólimon,\nManwendil, and Atanalcar, and a daughter, Tindómiel. Elros died in SA\n442, after ruling Númenor for 410 years.",

    "text": "FREDEGAR “FATTY” BOLGER was one of the small group of Hobbits who knew\nthat Frodo had the Ring. Fatty was a descendant of Hildibrand Took (TA\n2849 - TA 2934), one of the many sons of the Gerontius Took. He was the\nson of Odovacar Bolger and Rosamunda Took. Fatty was born in TA 2980.\n\nHe had a younger sister, ESTELLA (TA 2985 - ?), who married Meriadoc\nBrandybuck.\n\n\nHistory\n\n Fatty, along with Folco Boffin, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin is one of Frodo Baggins's friends, and helped move his things\nfrom Bag End to his new home at Crickhollow. There, he and Merry welcome\nFrodo, Sam and Pippin when those three arrive from Bucklebury.\n\nWhen Frodo and the rest set out to take the Ring to Rivendell, Fredegar\nstayed behind at Crickhollow in an attempt to keep up appearances and\ndelay news of their departure. He was frightened half out of his wits by\nthe arrival of the Nazgûl but escaped unharmed. Fredegar could have gone\nwith Frodo and his companions into the Old Forest, but was terrified of\nthe stories about it. Though Merry tried to persuade him that the Old\nForest would be nothing compared to meeting the Ringwraiths, Fatty was\nadamant, so the other Hobbits went into the forest with only the\nknowledge of Merry to aid them. Soon while Frodo and his other friends\nleft Fatty stayed to make Frodo seem like he hadn't left. Then on\nSeptember the 30th Fredegard was attacked by Nazgûl and ran to the\nnearest house and raised the Horn-call of Buckland and so the Nazgûl\nleft.\n\nDuring Saruman's rule of the Shire he led a group of partisans fighting\nagainst the Ruffians around the Hills of Scary, before eventually being\ncaptured. He and his sons were imprisoned in the Lockholes and starved,\nmeaning that after his release nobody could call him Fatty any more.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIn earlier drafts of _The Lord of the Rings_ Fatty Bolger played a much\nlarger role, but this was later abandoned. His role survives as a minor\nanomaly in the book — before the Hobbits go into the Old Forest, they\nhave five ponies prepared — but only take four. Bolger was originally\nsupposed to go with them.\n\nIt might be argued that Fredegar Bolger is the least heralded but\nperhaps the most significant of all the heroes of the War of the Rings:\nby delaying the Nazgul just slightly, he may well have turned the whole\ncourse of the War in favor of the West away from Sauron.... and for his\nheroism is starved in the Lockholes.\n\n\n\nSMALL APPEARANCE IN THE MOVIE\n\nIn the extended edition of the Fellowship of the Ring, there is a brief\nclip of Bilbo greeting Fatty Bolger, however, they do not show his face,\nand the clip is very brief. Some minutes later he appears again,\ncheering as Bilbo shouts his name. Though it is not confirmed that the\nhobbit cheering was Fatty, it is likely, as his appearance is very\nsimilar to that of the Fatty Bolger Bilbo greeted.",

His life as Lord of Andúnie and as\none of the Faithful sired the High Kings of Gondor and Arnor who\npreserved their ways through the Dúnedain of Middle-earth on up to\nAragorn II Elessar. Elendil the Tall was his son.\n\n\nBiography\n\nIn the youth of Amandil he had great friendship with Pharazôn who had\nkinship with him through his father's mother Inzilbêth.\n\nWhen Pharazôn married Tar-Míriel and he took the Scepter of Númenor he\nbecame corrupted by his father's counsel and Pharazôn and Amandil became\nestranged. Amandil, who was the leader of the Faithful in Númenor though\nnot openly, supported the ban of the Valar and for the old traditions\nwhereas Pharazôn followed the counsel of his father and that of his own\nwill. Pharazôn deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to\ntheir support of the old King Tar-Palantir and he commanded Amandil to\ndwell in Rómenna. Andúnië he took and made it to his chief harbour of\nhis ships but he did not dismiss him from his council or in any other\nway molest him.\n\nIn SA 3261 Pharazôn brought Sauron to Númenor and over the years he was\nbeing convinced by the lies of Sauron.\n\nSensing the impending doom of Númenor, he urged his son Elendil not to\ninterfere in the upcoming war, but to expect, and prepare for, a forced\ndeparture from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Valinor,\nthere to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the\nNúmenórean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.\n\nHe departed into the West either SA 3310 and SA 3316, just before\nthe Great Armament was ready to launch in an attempt to reach Valinor\nand save Númenor. He set sail in a small ship with three servants dear\nto him (though no names are given for them) at night from Rómenna\nsteering East, like it was his goal to reach Middle-earth, but soon he\nturned and journeyed into the West. He never returned, and was never\nheard from again.\n\nWhether Amandil's voyage was successful is unknown, but soon after the\ndestruction of Númenor, a great wave carried Elendil's ships safely to\nMiddle-earth, suggesting that his pleas were indeed heard.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMANDIL_'s name means “Lover of Aman” or perhaps “Devoted to Aman” in\nQuenya.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn Tolkien's unfinished time-travel story “The Lost Road” Amandil has\nthe name Valandil “friend of Gods”, which for a high Court official in\nthe later days of Pharazon was doubtless a bad idea. It is likely that\nTolkien (though this is nowhere stated) intended Valandil to have\ndiscreetly changed his name to Amandil, still thus keeping his loyalty\nknown but not so bluntly as Valandil would have done.\n\nAs Tolkien, had he finished it, was intending to work in the Seven\nSleepers legend, Amandil and his three servants may well have been\ncandidates for the Seven.",

He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II\nOakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.\n\nA Dwarf Lord, Balin was old and wise, he was one of Thorin's closest\nfriends and advisors, and was always willing to listen and offer wise\ncounsel. Balin is distantly related to Thorin, and is a descendant of\nthe noble house of Durin.\n\nHe later went to reestablish the kingdom of Dwarves, Moria, but in five\nyears it was reovercome by Orcs, and he was killed there.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nBalin was a Dwarf, son of Fundin, and likely born in the Lonely Mountain\nbefore the coming of Smaug the Dragon. He had a younger brother named\nDwalin and was one of those driven from their homes when the dragon\nSmaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards he may have lived in\nDunland as a refugee. He fought in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. Many\nyears later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the\nfather of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain\nhimself, but Thráin was captured and lost.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nBalin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield that\njourneys to the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat\nSmaug and retake the mountain kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf\nto arrive at Bilbo's house, where like his brother Dwalin he played a\nviol as big as himself. Among the Dwarves of the company, Balin was the\nsecond-eldest dwarf on the quest, and loosely, held the position of\ndeputy leader. He led the Dwarves in their escape from the spiders and,\nwhen Thorin was absent, spoke for the party when the Elven King\nThranduil captured them.\n\nHe is described as “always their look-out man”: He spots Bilbo\napproaching The Green Dragon Inn at Bywater, he spots the trolls' fire,\nand he's the first to spot the Elves in Mirkwood. He noted that not even\na mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice\nBilbo (hidden by wearing the magic ring) when he was lookout for the\ncompany after escaping the Orcs in the Misty Mountains.\n\nBalin gained respect for Bilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who\nvolunteered to accompany Bilbo down the secret passage to Smaug's\nchamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, Balin was the only one known\nto have visited Bilbo at Bag End after their experiences on the quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain.\n\nExpedition and Death\n\n\n\nBalin later led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient dwarf\nkingdom of Moria, hoping to regain both the wealth of Moria and the last\nof the Seven Rings of the Dwarves. Ultimately, the search for the\nring—which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owners—was\nin vain, as it had been recaptured from Thráin II by Sauron.

A lover of\nwater, Ulmo was one of the Arda's chief architects and was always in a\nclose friendship with Manwë. He always distrusted Melkor, and the Dark\nLord feared the Sea almost as much as he feared Varda because the sea\ncannot be tamed. Ulmo had no dwelling in Valinor or any permanent\ndwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers.\nHis palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan. Biography Ulmo\nseldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great need.\nHe preferred to stay in Arda, not by walking on the land, as his form\nwould fill man or elf with great dread. All waters were under his\ngovernment: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. Where the\npower of Morgoth was strong, however, Ulmo's own power would be sapped\nfrom waters near to Morgoth's corruption. It is through the rivers that\nhe kept in touch with Arda, and thus knew more of the goings on with the\nChildren of Ilúvatar than even Manwë, for in that way he lived in the\nvery veins of the world. His visible form caused fear in mortals and\neven the Elves, as he dressed like a giant wave in glittering green\narmour, blowing his great horns, the Ulumúri. Ulmo always loved the\nEldar and the Edain, even when the Valar forsook Middle-earth. He\nopposed Oromë's plan to bring the elves to Aman, but helped those that\nwere willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island which was later\nknown as Tol Eressëa and used it to ferry them across the Belegaer to\nthe Blessed Realm. Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay of Eldamar,\nwhich he did because he knew the minds of the Teleri. Ulmo was the Vala\nmost responsible for the fall of Morgoth, by urging Turgon to build\nGondolin and Finrod to build Nargothrond (FA 50). He appeared before\nTuor and urged him to go to Gondolin as a messenger to Turgon. When he\ngot there, he eventually married Turgon's daughter Idril and fathered\nEärendil. Ulmo saved Eärendil's wife Elwing from the sack of the Havens\nof Sirion, allowing her to take a Silmaril to her husband, which allowed\nhim to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for aid.

Biography Before she came to\nMiddle-earth, Melian served both Vána and Estë, and dwelt in Lórien\ntending the trees that grew in the Gardens of Irmo. Among all of her\npeople none were wiser, (With the possible exception of Gandalf) more\nbeautiful, or more skilled in singing enchanting songs than Melian. She\nloved the deep shadows of the great trees. When the light of the Two\nTrees would mingle Melian would sing and the Valar would stop their work\nand listen. Nightingales went with her wherever she went, and she taught\nthem their song. Of all the Valar she was most akin to Yavanna. When the\nElves awoke on the shore of Cuiviénen she departed from Valinor and went\nto Middle-earth, where she filled its silence with her singing and the\nsinging of her birds. While in the forest of Nan Elmoth she met and fell\nin love with the Elven-king Elu Thingol, and later she ruled the kingdom\nof Doriath by his side. For thousands of years, she used her powers to\nguard and defend the city with a protection spell called the _Girdle of\nMelian_, but she predicted that one person would one day breach this\ndefense. The Girdle functioned to bewilder any who attempted to enter\nDoriath, and was so potent that even Ungoliant was unable to bypass it.\nShe and her husband had a child, a daughter named Lúthien. During her\nstay in Doriath she became a friend and mentor of Galadriel. Melian\nwanted to know the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only\nbriefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. But\neventually she and Thingol learned the truth. Melian's main line of\ndescent is of the Half-elven, and through her daughter the Maian blood\npassed to both Elves and Men. When Beren arrived as foretold, she\ncounseled Thingol against sending Beren for a Silmaril, a quest which\nwould eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. A friend of Mankind, she also\naided Húrin's family by hosting Túrin in Doriath and later helped Beleg\nCúthalion in his search for Túrin by giving him Lembas. When Húrin came\nto Doriath old and carrying a great grief and misery on him, Melian\nhelped him see through his ills. After Thingol's death she left Doriath,\nvisiting Beren and Lúthien for a time warning them of the Dwarves\ntreachery, and the curse on the Mîm's treasure. Shortly there-after, she\nwent back to Valinor, musing upon her sorrows in the gardens of Lorien\nwhence she came. Etymology _Melian_ is Sindarin, from the Quenya\n_Melyanna_, of which the roots are _mel_ (love) and _anna_ (gift). The\nname means “dear gift.” Earlier versions of Melian's name were\n'''Gwenniel '''and GWENETHLIN. _Beren and Lúthien_ (2017) reintroduces\nthe names GWENDELING and GWENDELIN into the 'complete story'.

    "text": "TULKAS (Quenya; IPA: - “Strong” or “Steadfast”) is an Ainu, a Vala who\nwas responsible for participating in war and the last of them to descend\ninto Arda, coming to the aid of the others when he heard of their war\nwith Melkor. He was also called TULUKASTĀZ or ASTALDO. Biography Having\nheard of his fellow Valar's struggle against Melkor, Tulkas was the last\nof the Valar to descend upon Arda, thus tipping the scales of battle\nagainst Melkor. Melkor fled before him, and the Spring of Arda was\nbegun. After the Two Lamps were erected and the Valar had made their\nfirst dwelling at Almaren, Tulkas wedded Nessa in a great feast. Being\nweary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had\ncome. When the Children of Ilúvatar awoke, there was a council among the\nValar regarding Melkor. Much to Tulkas's delight, it was decided that\nMelkor should be removed. During the War for Sake of the Elves, he\nwrestled with Melkor and bound him with Angainor, which was forged by\nAulë. Upon Melkor's release from captivity, Tulkas remained vigilant and\ndistrustful of him. Character Tulkas is described as delighting in\nwrestling and contests of strength. He wields no weapon, and rides no\nsteed. As he cares little about either past or future, he was not a good\ncouncillor, but nonetheless a very hardy friend. He is described as\nbeing slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive; for that reason, he was\none of the Valar that opposed the release of Melkor. In appearance,\nTulkas was described to have ruddy flesh and golden hair and beard. He\nalso tended to be impatient; before the Awakening of the Elves he urged\nthe other Valar to wage war against Melkor. After the Darkening of\nValinor he also hurried Fëanor to take a decision about surrendering the\nSilmarils. Tulkas was known for laughing in sport and in battle. He was\npossibly the only being on Arda with the courage to laugh in the face of\nMelkor, the most powerful being in Valinor (at the time) - and did so\nonce while engaged in battle with him. Despite not being one of the\nAratar, Morgoth feared Tulkas more than any of the other Valar. He was\nalso the strongest (physically) of all the Valar. Most likely, he was\nphysically stronger than Morgoth, as it was he who first chained him\nwith Angainor. Etymology In Quenya, the name _TULKAS_ means “Strong” and\n“Steadfast”, from the root _tuluk_. His Valarin name is TULUKHASTĀZ,\nwhich means “the golden-haired”, from the words _tulukha(n)_ (“yellow”)\nand _(a)sata-_ (“hair of head”). His Ñoldorin name is TULCUS (“Strong”).\nASTALDO means “the Valiant”. Other names An earlier name for Tulkas was\nTURENBO. Earlier versions of the legendarium In earlier texts, Tulkas\noverthrows Melkor during the battle of the Silent Pools and bounds him\nfor Lumbi. Here, the Hound of Mandos, Gorgumoth, guards Melkor in his\ncaptivity. In an earlier context, Tulkas had a son Telimektar, “whose\ntale is yet to tell”. Gallery",

    "text": "AREDHEL, also known as AREDHEL AR-FEINIEL, the “White Lady of the\nÑoldor”, was the only daughter and third child of the Noldorin\nHigh-prince Fingolfin and his wife Anairë. Aredhel was the sister of\nFingon, Turgon and Argon, and the mother of Maeglin.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nAredhel was born in YT 1362, the same year as her cousin Galadriel,\nand lived in Tirion. She followed her father and brothers through\nHelcaraxë and dwelt in Nevrast with her brother Turgon until Gondolin\nwas complete, and when it was she went with him to the hidden city. But\nafter two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands\novercame her, and she asked leave to depart. Turgon was unwilling,\nfearing the exposure of the Hidden Kingdom, but eventually relented and\nallowed her to leave.\n\nRiding with companions Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth, they were\ndenied entrance to Doriath, it being closed to the Ñoldor. But they did\ntell her of the best way to find the Sons of Fëanor, and so they went\naround to the north, where she was separated in the dangerous region of\nNan Dungortheb and reported lost. However, she reached Himlad safely,\nand waited there to meet Celegorm who was abroad, but eventually she\nwandered out of boredom and became lost in the forest of Nan Elmoth.\n\n\n\nEöl the Dark Elf ruled those woods; seeing Aredhel and noticing her\nbeauty, he set enchantments about her so that she could not escape the\nforest. Eventually, she wandered to Eöl's dwelling in the woods, where\nhe finally revealed himself to her. After marrying him, she stayed with\nhim many years. They had a son named Maeglin, and telling him of her\nformer life and home, she desired to see them again, and left Nan Elmoth\nwith Maeglin while Eöl was away. They reached Gondolin (not realizing\nthat Eöl was following them all the while), and were received with\nrejoicing. Eöl was also discovered and brought before Turgon, but rather\nthan accept Turgon's judgment to remain, he attempted to kill his son\nfor disobeying him with a poisoned javelin concealed in his cloak.\nAredhel stepped in front of it and was hit by it and because of its\npoison, she died that night from the wound.\n\nEöl was cast down from the city walls and died, while Maeglin became\nmighty in Gondolin but later betrayed it to Morgoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHer name in Quenya was IRISSË. The names AREDHEL (“noble elf”) and\nAR-FEINIEL (“noble white lady”) were both originally intended to stand\nalone, and be used as the main name of Irissë.\n\nWhile preparing _The Silmarillion_ for publication Christopher Tolkien\ncould not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name,\nand he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated in\n_The History of Middle-earth_ series was possibly mistaken.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nAredhel was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests.\nHer skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white.\nThough fond of the Sons of Fëanor, she never fell in love with any of\nthem.\n\n\nGallery",

    "text": "GOTHMOG (Sindarin IPA: - “Strife and Hate”) was the Lord of Balrogs\nduring the First Age, and the greatest Balrog ever to walk Middle-earth.\nAs the High Captain of Angband, his only equal in rank was Sauron. He\nfought many battles in the name of his master Morgoth, and was\npersonally responsible for killing two of the High Kings of the Ñoldor.\nGothmog, like the rest of his kind, carried a fiery whip into battle,\nbut he was also known to have wielded a great black axe, which was\nfeared by elves across the continent of Beleriand. Biography Gothmog was\ninitially one of the Maiar who were under the allegiance of Melkor.\nPrior to the Revolt of the Ñoldor, he was the High Captain of Angband\nand given the title “Lord of the Balrogs.” During the Dagor-nuin-Giliath\nin YT 1498, Fëanor pressed to Angband with his company, and in that\nhour, the Balrogs were issued forth. Gothmog was among them. Fëanor came\neven within sight of Angband, but was ambushed with few elves about him.\nSoon he stood alone, but long he fought on alone with all balrogs.\nGothmog turned in at the end of the bout, and at the last Gothmog, Lord\nof the Balrogs, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound, and\nthe High King of the Ñoldor plunged to the ground. The Sons of Fëanor\narrived and carried the body of their father away, but Fëanor had\npassed. Gothmog reappeared as a general of Angband in several more major\nconflicts, including the Dagor Aglareb and the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\nDuring the Nirnaeth, Gothmog engaged the High King of the Ñoldor,\nFingon, in battle. Gothmog separated Fingon from the main host but was\nunable to kill Fingon until another Balrog appeared behind the Ñoldor\n“cast a throng of steel about him”. This allowed Gothmog to slay Fingon\nand beat the body to dust. Thereafter, he captured Húrin, father of\nTúrin Turambar, and dragged him back to Angband. In FA 510, Gothmog and\nthe forces of Angband beseiged the Hidden City of Gondolin. They held\nthe northern gates and were later confronted by Ecthelion of the\nFountain, whom Gothmog dueled. Knocking Ecthelion's sword out of his\nhands, Gothmog prepared to strike at him but, as he raised his axe,\nEcthelion ran forward at the Balrog lord, ramming his pointed helmet\ninto the beast's chest and forcing both of them into the Fountain of the\nKing. The waters quenched the flames of Gothmog that kept him alive and\ndrowned Ecthelion, ending the Battle of Gondolin. Etymology The name\n_Gothmog_ is from the Quenyan terms _gos_ or _goth_ (“dread”) and\n_-mbaw_ (“compel, force, subject, oppress”). Gothmog's Quenya name was\nOSOMBAUKO (or OÞOMBAUKO; IPA: or Vanyarin ). His name in Sindarin means\n“Strife and Hate”. Other versions of the legendarium Gothmog was briefly\nconceived as a “son of Melkor and the ogress Fuithluin”, and went by the\nname of KOSOMOT. The root of the name _moko_ translates to “hate”. There\nwas another concept of the Children of the Ainur, Melkor had a son\nKosomot (later Gothmog) with an ogress called Fuithluin. Gallery",

She was notable for her speed, being fast “as\nan arrow in movement”, for which reason she was called _NESSA THE\nSWIFT_. Biography Nessa was the sister of Oromë. She was lithe and swift\nof foot and Nessa loved fast moving creatures such as deer. And the deer\nfollowed her train wherever she went even into the wild regions of Aman.\nNessa could outrun the deer with great speed with the wind in her hair.\nNessa married Tulkas aka _TULKAS THE STRONG_, during the Spring of Arda.\nBefore the destruction of the _Isle of Almaren_, the first dwelling of\nthe Valar, Nessa delighted in dancing and would often dance on the great\ngreen grass of Almaren; and later, in Valinor on never-fading green\nlawns. Henceforth, as the Valar had finished with their labours in the\ncreation of Arda, King Manwë ordained a great feast on Almaren. So the\nValar were gathered upon Almaren during the _Spring of Arda_; and it was\nsung that on this great feast, Nessa wedded Tulkas there at that time\nwhere Nessa's sister-in-law, _Vána the Ever-young_,'' ''wife of Oromë,\nrobed Nessa with her flowers. Thereon, Nessa danced before the Valar\nupon the green grass of Almaren. The dwelling of Nessa and Tulkas was\nsaid to be a house full of mirth and revelry. For in the House of\nTulkas, his warriors played and rivaled one another there in doughty\nfeats. At times, Nessa would bear goblets of wine and cooling drinks\namong the champions of her husband. After the flight of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth, like most of the Valar, Nessa also desired ease and peace\njust like the ancient days of Valinor. Wishing not for the rumour of\nMelkor nor for the murmurs of the Ñoldor to come ever again among them\nand disturb their happiness. As a result for such reasons, most of the\nValar clamored for the concealment of their land. Hence, the Hiding of\nValinor took place. Etymology NESSA comes from the Quenya _neth_\n(“young”). Other names Two earlier names for Nessa were HELINYETILLE,\nthe “Eyes of Heartsease”, from _helin_ (“violet, pansy”), and MELESTA,\nfrom _mele_ (“to love”). Character Nessa loved most to retire to the\nfair ever-green lawns of Valinor which Oromë had cultivated from the\nrichness of all his forest glades. For it was told that, when Yavanna\n(_Queen of the Earth_) created the forests of Oromë, she had planted\nthere these forest glades with spells so that these glades would always\nremain green and smooth. There in the fair lawns of Valinor, Nessa along\nwith her maidens would dance as long as the great golden Tree Laurelin''\n_was in bloom._'' It was told that she herself was a greater dancer than\nVána, for Nessa was not just known for her notable speed but for her\ndancing abilities as well. Other Versions in the Legendarium In the\nearlier texts, Nessa and Estë were considered “highest among the Maiar”.\nLea the Young was the wife of Tulkas, and was later changed to Nessa.\nNessa was once envisioned as the daughter of Vána.

    "text": "NIENNA (Quenya; IPA or - “Weeping” or “She Who Weeps”) was an Ainu, one\nof the Aratar and a Vala who was responsible for the mercy and grief\nspread across Arda. She was the sister of Mandos and Irmo and had no\nspouse. Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, from\nwhich grief entered the world at its beginning. She had dominion over\nthe Halls of Nienna, which were on the western edge of Valinor, looking\nover the sea. Biography Nienna was concerned with mourning, and she\npitied the suffering of others, especially the Marring of Arda by\nMelkor. Yet the lesson of Nienna is not of endless grief, but rather of\npity, hope, and the endurance of the spirit. Nienna dwelt in far western\nValinor near Mandos, and she seldom came to Valimar. Her windows looked\nout beyond the Walls of the Night. During the creation of the Two Trees,\nshe watered the mound with her tears. The pity of Nienna is most clearly\nseen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar.\nThough she spent her time in the world mourning for the destruction he\nhad wreaked in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of\nCaptivity, Nienna spoke on his behalf. After the Flight of the Ñoldor,\nNienna mourned for the destruction of the Two Trees, and her tears\nbrought healing, but could not heal the mortal wounds. Thus, the trees\nbrought forth their last flower and fruit, and made into the Sun and\nMoon. All that is known about her appearance is that she wore a grey\nhood. Given that Gandalf was her greatest student, his being clothed in\ngrey may have been a mark of respect to his teacher.

She taught him pity and many other things\nbefore he was chosen as the second wizard sent to lead the people of\nMiddle-earth into standing against Sauron. Etymology _NIENNA_ means\n''weeping ''or ''she who weeps _in Quenya and_ _comes_ ''from the root\n_nei_ (“tear”). Other versions of the legendarium In earlier versions,\nNienna was the sister of Manwë and Melkor, and was called “queen of\nshadow”. In _The Book of Lost Tales 1_, a character similar to Nienna\nwas called FUI (Night), the Death-Goddess. In Gnomish she was FUIL, the\nQueen of the Dark. She dwelt in halls that bore her name, and had a roof\nof bats' wings. As _Fui_, she was the spouse of Vefantur (Mandos in\nTolkien's later writings) and dwelt in his halls of Ve. She judged the\nhumans while Vefantur judged the elves. HESKIL (Winter One) and NÚRI\n(One who Sighs) were her names as well. She was also called QALME-TARI\n(Mistress of Death).

    "text": "OLWË was an Elf of the Teleri of Aman. When he and his kin reached Aman,\nthey chose to remain there in both Tol Eressëa and Alqualondë apart from\nthe rest of the Elves of Aman. He became both Lord of Alqualondë and\nKing of the Teleri.\n\nOlwë was the father of Eärwen and had several unnamed sons. He was\nthe younger brother of Elwë (Elu Thingol) and the older brother of\nElmo. Other Telerin elves such Nowë (Círdan) were said to be akin to\nOlwë.\n\n\nBiography\n\nElwë and Olwë were both lords of the third clan of the elves, the later\nTeleri, and together they lead their people from Cuiviénen to the\nWest. However, during a long wait in Beleriand Elwë disappeared.\nAfter years of searching, Olwë grew impatient, and led the greater part\nof the Teleri to Valinor, on the insistence of the Vala Ulmo.\n\nOlwë became Lord of the island of Tol Eressëa, where the Teleri built a\ngreat number of cities, and grew in number. When they finally came to\nEldamar some centuries later, Olwë became Lord of Alqualondë. His\ndaughter Eärwen married Finarfin son of Finwë and later High King of\nthe Ñoldor in Valinor, and thus their children, when these returned to\nMiddle-earth, could claim kinship to Thingol, for Eärwen had several\nsons.\n\nWhen Fëanor resolved to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, he\ncame to Alqualondë and spoke to the Teleri asking for aid and for the\nuse of the Swanships but he could not move them. He then grew hot and\nwrathful and, grudging he spoke to Olwë, he accused him of renouncing\ntheir friendship and for being ungrateful for the help that the Ñoldor\nhad given his people in the past. Then Olwë said to Fëanor that this was\nnot so and that he believed that as a friend it was right for him to\nkeep a friend from doing something unwise. Then he spoke to him of the\nmany things that they accomplished on their own without any aid from the\nÑoldor, and that the Swanships were one of those things and were very\ndear to them.\n\nSeeing that he was not going to get what he wanted, Fëanor waited beyond\nthe walls until he gathered his strength and then in defiance of Olwë he\nand his people began manning the ships. His people resisted and a battle\nhad begun and many on both sides were slain, but the Teleri withstood\nthem for a time. Then the host of Fingon arrived and believing that the\nTeleri had been told to waylay the Ñoldor by command of the Valar,\njoined the battle and the Teleri were overcome.

Towards the end of the First Age when the Valar\nwere preparing for the final assault on Morgoth, the Teleri of Olwë\nagreed only to sail the ships for very few of them were willing to go to\nwar.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIt is mentioned that the name OLWË seems to have no meaning. There are\nprovided “extended” stems such as _olos_ (“dream”) and _olob_ (“branch”)\nbut no connections to the Telerin elf. He was called VOLWË by some\nof the Teleri.",

    "text": "VARDA (Quenya; IPA: - “Sublime” or “Lofty”) is an Ainu, and one of the\nAratar and a Vala who was responsible for the outlining of the stars in\nthe heavens above Arda. She was also known as '''Elbereth (SINDARIN;\nIPA: “QUEEN OF THE STARS”) '''or GILTHONIEL, and was the spouse of\nManwë, with whom she lives in Ilmarin on the summit of Taniquetil in\nAman.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nVarda was the most beautiful of all the Valar, and her beauty was said\nto be beyond the description of Men and Elves, for her face radiates the\nlight of Eru Ilúvatar. Unsurprisingly, the province over which she ruled\nwas light, to the extent where it was said that _“in light is her power\nand her joy”._\n\nEven before Melkor first began to create his discord, Varda しknew his\nmind well, and rejected him because of it, and was always his enemy from\nthat moment on. As a result of this, Melkor also hated Varda the most\nout of the Valar, and feared her more than all others whom Eru had\ncreated.\n\nVarda came to Arda with her husband, Manwë, and the other Valar in the\nbeginning of days. She aided Manwë in the rule of Arda and the watching\nof Middle-earth. She made the stars, filled the Lamps of the Valar with\nlight, collected the dew of the Two Trees in her Wells, fashioned the\nnewer stars and constellations in preparation for the Awakening of the\nElves, hallowed the Silmarils, established the courses of the Moon and\nSun, and set the Star of Eärendil in the sky.\n\nBecause of her creation of the stars, the Elves of Middle-earth revere\nand love her the most out of the Valar. They even gave her the name of\n“Elbereth”, invoke her in times where they require aid, and sing her\npraises whenever the stars rise. It was also said that when Manwë sits\nbeside her upon their throne on Taniquetil, she was able to hear more\nclearly than any other ears, the prayers and laments of those in need\nfrom the furthest east even unto the west.\n\nAt times, she would answer the prayers of not only Elves, but also those\nof other races. For example, during the War of the Ring, she aided Sam\nthrough the Phial of Galadriel (which contained the Light of Eärendil)\nduring his struggle against Shelob.\n\n\nMaiar of Varda\n\n-   Ilmarë, the handmaiden of Varda and Queen of the Maiar alongside\n    Eonwë, Manwë's herald.\n-   Olorin (Gandalf), the second-in-command (and later leader) of the\n    wizards sent to Middle-Earth to combat Sauron.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n-   Varda'' _means_ sublime ''or _lofty_ in Quenya.\n-   Elentári means ''queen of the stars ''in Quenya.\n-   Gilthoniel means ''kindler of the stars ''in Sindarin.\n-   She is probably best known by her Sindarin name, ELBERETH\n    GILTHONIEL, as Frodo uttered that name at Weathertop to drive away\n    the Ringwraiths.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\n-   In NetHack and some other Roguelike games, the name _Elbereth_ is\n    used as a protective charm. For more, read the NetHack Elbereth FAQ;\n    for a wiki page, try Elbereth.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   “Varda” (ורדה) is a Hebrew name meaning “Rose”, and is a common\n    female first name in contemporary Israel.

    "text": "HADOR Goldenhead, known also as HADOR LÓRINDOL, was a great chieftain of\nthe Edain in the First Age of Middle-earth, and a revered Edain among\nmany of the greatest Elf-friends of the Eldar. He became the first Lord\nof Dor-lómin and was accounted mighty even among the Eldar. Hador and\nhis wife Gildis had three children: Glóredhel the first child and only\ndaughter, Galdor the second child and elder son, and Gundor the last\nchild and younger son.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nHador was the son of Hathol and the great-great-grandson of Marach, (who\nfirst led the people of the Third House into Beleriand and was their\nfirst chieftain), and heir to the House of Marach. He entered the\nservice of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, at a young age. Hador\nwas loved by the King, and he rose high in the esteem of many of the\nEldar. Eventually, Hador would even become a part of Fingolfin's own\ncouncil. Realizing the need for the Edain to live under their own lords\nand have lands of their own, Fingolfin granted as a fief to Hador the\nland of Dor-lómin (land of echoes) which thus made him the first Lord of\nDor-lómin. Hador gathered most of the people of the Third House into\nthat land, which lay in Hithlum between the Kingdom of Fingolfin and his\neldest son Fingon. There, Hador's people became numerous; and he\nencouraged the use of the Sindarin tongue.\n\nHador continued to win renown among the Eldar as the Lord of Dor-lómin,\nas well as among Men. Two of Hador's children, Galdor and Glóredhel,\nwere wedded to two of the children of Halmir Chieftain of the Haladin,\nrespectively Hareth his daughter and Haldir his son of the House of\nHaleth, when the two peoples met for a great feast. Fingolfin also gave\nto Hador a great helm made by Telchar of Nogrod. It was made in the\nlikeness of the dragon Glaurung, and came to be known as the Dragon-helm\nof Dor-lómin; it could only be borne by one of great stature and\nstrength. In the year 455 of the First Age, Morgoth broke the Siege of\nAngband in the Dagor Bragollach. Hador fought alongside Fingolfin with\nwhat few warriors of the Third House he could gather against the swift\nonset of Morgoth's forces. He was slain, however, defending the retreat\nof his lord. His younger son, Gundor, fell beside him before the\nfortress of Eithel Sirion. It was said that their deaths were greatly\nmourned by the Eldar.\n\n\n\nThough he was accounted one of the mightiest chieftain of the Edain in\nthe First Age, Hador is not well-known aside from being the namesake of\nthe Third House of the Edain. However, he was the forefather of many\nother heroes. His grandsons were Hurin and Huor. His great-grandsons\nwere Túrin and Tuor Eladar, and his great-great grandson was Eärendil\nthe Mariner. Aragorn Elessar, as well as all the Kings of Númenor,\nGondor and Arnor were descended from Hador. Maybe the best thing ever\nsaid regarding the legacy of Hador was this passage, written by J.R.R.\nTolkien in the Silmarillion:\n\n  “The Men of the Three Houses throve and multiplied, but greatest among\n  them was the house of Hador Goldenhead, peer of Elven-lords. His\n  people were of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and\n  steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children\n  of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind.”",

Biography Mablung, along with Daeron, came to the Mereth\nAderthad bearing gifts and friendship from Doriath. He also served in\nMenegroth in some unknown position of command. Together with Beleg\nCúthalion, he was one of the great captains of the Sindar, and were the\nonly Elves of Doriath to fight with the Union of Maedhros in the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, as King Thingol would have nothing to do with the\nwar. Mablung was was part of the Hunting of the Wolf together with King\nThingol, Beleg, Huan and Beren, who later married Lúthien. During the\nfight with the wolf, Huan is killed and Beren mortally wounded. After\nthe great beast is killed, Mablung is the one to slice open the wolf's\nbelly and retrieve the silmaril. Mablung was present when Túrin fought\nwith Saeros over his taunting and restrained Túrin's wrath to avoid a\nbrawl in the King's hall. Mablung then attempted to stop Saeros from\ntaking his threats too far and warned him of Túrin's strength, should he\nattempt to fight him. Aware that a fight had broken out between the two,\nMablung was present at the final play in the drama and tried to stop\nthings from ending badly. It was to no avail Saeros ran despairingly in\nfear and fell off a brink where a stream ran into the Esgalduin, and\nstruck his head on a rock and died. Later, Mablung was present before\nThingol's throne where he accounted for everything that had gone on\nbetween Saeros and Túrin, and later accounts of Túrin’s choice to leave\nDoriath. Mablung became captain of the guard of Doriath after Beleg left\nto seek Túrin. When Morwen Eledhwen, who dwelt in Doriath at the time,\nlearned of the fall of Nargothrond and that her son Túrin might be\nthere, she wished to seek him out. Mablung was assigned by Thingol to\nguard her on their way. Unknown to both Mablung and Morwen until too\nlate, Nienor daughter of Morwen, had joined them. Mablung was unable to\nprevent them both from being ensnared in the traps of Glaurung, the\ndragon of Morgoth. Mablung hid from Glaurung and then searched the\nsacked Nargothrond, finding no sign of Túrin.  Nienor was found again by\nMablung, in a trance, by the spell of Glaurung, at Amon Ethir. Mablung\nthen led her back to Doriath, but he later lost her again when she ran\noff unclad started by a band of Orcs; a result of the spell of Glaurung.\nThus she fled beyond the sight of Mablung. Unable to recover her Mablung\nreturned to Doriath, but he spent years afterwards searching for Morwen\nand Nienor. Mablung went to Brethil when he learned Glaurung was there,\nand there met Túrin. By admitting Nienor was lost he caused Túrin to\nrealize that Níniel his wife had actually been his sister Nienor and\nTúrin killed himself. Mablung was the last person to whom Melian spoke\nbefore departing Middle-earth. She warned him about Thingol's Silmaril\nand to send word to Beren and Lúthien. Soon after Mablung was killed\nbefore the doors of the treasury during the Sack of Menegroth by the\nDwarves of Nogrod. Etymology The name _MABLUNG_ is a Sindarin word that\nmeans _Heavy Hand_. It was probably not his real name, but an epessë\n(honorary title). His real name is unknown.",

    "text": "TURGON was a Ñoldorin Elf of Gondolin, second son of Fingolfin, brother\nof Fingon, Aredhel, Argon, and father of Idril. In Middle-earth, Turgon\nwas the King of Gondolin and the High King of the Ñoldor. For hundreds\nof years of the First Age, Turgon remained successfully hidden from the\neyes and ears of Morgoth until a betrayal from within caused his\ndownfall.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nIn Eldamar Turgon was friendly with the sons of Finarfin and opposed\nFëanor's plan to pursue Morgoth after the theft of the Silmarils, but\neventually he chose to follow them to Middle-earth and became one of the\nexiles. His wife Elenwë was lost crossing Helcaraxë, but Turgon and\nhis daughter Idril came to Nevrast, where he built Vinyamar and gathered\nto him one-third of the Ñoldor of Fingolfin and a large number of\nSindar.\n\nIn the year 50 of the First Age, Turgon was instructed by Ulmo to\nprepare a secret kingdom and was shown the hidden valley of Tumladen in\nthe Encircling Mountains. After 52 years of secret labor, Turgon led his\npeople into Gondolin, where he ruled for over 500 years, largely\nignoring the events of the Wars of Beleriand.\n\nAbout two hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Turgon's sister\nAredhel journeyed to meet with the Sons of Fëanor. She was lost,\nhowever, and returned with her son Maeglin a few years later. After the\ndeaths of both Eöl and Aredhel, Turgon took Maeglin under his wing and\nmade him the Lord of the House of the Mole. Maeglin secretly loved\nTurgon's daughter Idril, who rejected his advances.\n\nAside from the misadventure of Eöl, the splendor of Turgon's reign in\nGondolin was undisturbed until Dagor Bragollach, when Turgon was brought\nhis father's body by Thorondor. Two years later Thorondor brought him\nHúrin and Huor, whom he fostered for a year and then allowed to return\nto Dor-lómin. At this time, Turgon foresaw the doom of the Ñoldor, and\nhe secretly sent mariners to try to obtain the mercy of the Valar.\nNone of these missions was successful and only one of the mariners,\nVoronwë, survived the Shadowy Seas paving the way for Tuor's coming to\nGondolin.\n\nTurgon joined the Union of Maedhros with a ten thousand strong army and\nfought alongside his brother Fingon in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, but the\nsacrifice of Húrin, Huor, and the Third House of the Edain enabled him\nto retreat without revealing the location of Gondolin. When Tuor came\nto Gondolin in FA 496, Turgon welcomed him, but in his pride, he refused\nto follow the advice of Ulmo to flee to the Havens of Sirion. Now the\nfull malice of Morgoth was directed toward Turgon, last of the House of\nFinwë to control a realm in Middle-earth. At last, aided by the\ntreachery of Maeglin, Morgoth discovered the location of Gondolin, and\nTurgon was slain defending the city.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe first element _tur_ of the name _TURGON_ is a Sindarin word for\n“power, mastery”. His father-name is TURUKÁNO, from _túrë_ (“might,\npower”) and _káno_ (“commander”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nAs King of Gondolin, Turgon was described to be robed “in white with a\nbelt of gold, and a coronet of garnets was upon his head”.\n\nHe was very much feared by Morgoth, and it is said in Valinor that\nMorgoth knew that from the House of Turgon would his ruin come. This\nholds true, as Turgon's grandson Eärendil was the one who indirectly\ncaused his downfall, in the later War of Wrath.",

    "text": "HELM HAMMERHAND was the ninth King of Rohan, and the end of the first\nline of its Kings. His rule was plagued by war with the Dunlendings that\nattempted to usurp his rule of Rohan.\n\n\nBiography\n\nHelm was born in TA 2691 and was the son of Gram. He became King at the\nage of fifty when his father Gram died in TA 2741 during a time of\ncrisis. His father had fought open warfare with the Dunlendings, who\noperated from the captured fortress of Isengard.\n\nDuring his reign, King Helm came into conflict with an arrogant,\nwealthy, and powerful landowner named Freca. Freca was a Dunlending with\nRohirric blood; he claimed to be a descendant of King Fréawine of Rohan.\nFreca held lands - both banks of the river Adorn and his stronghold was\nnear its source on the borders of Rohan. Freca viewed King Helm with\nboth contempt and scorn, while Helm mistrusted Freca and was wary of\nhim.\n\nIn TA 2754, Freca attempted to intimidate and coerce King Helm into\ngiving his approval and consent to an arranged marriage between Freca's\nson Wulf and Helm's daughter. Freca marched to a meeting of the King's\ncouncil in Edoras with a great force of men, planning to threaten the\nKing into complying with his demands. In the resulting quarrel, Helm\nHammerhand smote Freca with single blow from his fist. The blow was so\ngreat Freca died soon after. Enraged, the men of Freca left Edoras, and\nKing Helm declared Wulf and his kin enemies of the King.\n\nFour years later in TA 2758, a combined force of Dunlendings under the\nleadership of Wulf, and the Corsairs of Umbar overran Rohan. Helm was\ndefeated in battle at the Crossings of Isen, and Helm withdrew into the\nHornburg at Helm's Deep (which was later renamed in his honor). There,\nhe endured a long siege.\n\nWhile King Helm and his younger son Prince Háma were besieged in the\nHornburg, a force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf also\nbesieged Edoras. Prince Haleth, King Helm's elder son who was the last\ndefender to fall, led the defence of Edoras. He fell defending the doors\nof the Golden Hall .\n\nShortly after Yule 2758, Prince Háma accompanied by a small force went\nout to search for food, but he and his men were lost in a blizzard and\nnever seen again. The Hornburg held a large war-horn, and whenever it\nwas blown, Helm would break through the Dunlending ranks, slaying many\nof their men. Helm's came to fear him greatly during this time and it\nwas believed that he became so fierce and terrible, that he slew many of\nthem with his bare hands. It was also believed that when he grew hungry\nand had no food he ate men.\n\nIt was said that grief and hunger made Helm more ferocious. After one\nsuch sortie, Helm died and did not return; his body was discovered the\nnext morning frozen in the snow still standing, his eyes open, ready to\nfight. This led to a belief among the Rohirrim and Dunlendings that even\nin death the wraith of Helm Hammerhand still wandered through Rohan, and\ndefended the Hornburg. Helm died in TA 2759 at the age of sixty-eight.\nPrince Haleth and Prince Háma also died during the war; his nephew\nFréaláf Hildeson, who defeated the Dunlendings, succeeded Helm.\n\nHelm was called Hammerhand because of his great strength and prowess\nwith his fists: he was known to fight barehanded. This is sometimes\nattributed to a superstition that if “he used no weapon no weapon would\nupon bite him”.",

    "text": "HUAN was a great wolfhound of the First Age. He was given by the Vala\nOromë the Hunter to his friend Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor. Huan\nwas as large as a small horse, and accompanied Celegorm on his huntings.\nWhen the Ñoldor under Fëanor rebelled, Huan went with his master to\nMiddle-earth. Huan had been granted special powers by the Valar, and was\nallowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that\nhe could not be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever\nlived. Biography Huan was originally a Hound of Oromë in Valinor and was\neventually given to Celegorm, Fëanor's third son. He went into exile\nwith his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed\nwith his master in Himlad and later fled with him to Nargothrond after\ntheir defeat in the Dagor Bragollach. He became involved with the Quest\nfor the Silmaril. When Beren had left Lúthien and gone with Finrod\nFelagund to Angband but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Lúthien\nset out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and Curufin, who\nwere living in Nargothrond at the time and were hunting. Huan smelt\nLúthien and captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm\nand Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death\nby the hand of Sauron, and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, “for\nher own protection”, secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and\nthereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father Thingol. Huan felt pity\nfor Lúthien, and sought her out. Speaking for the first time, he told\nher of a way to escape, using a secret exit, and then accompanied her to\nTol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Lúthien's magic, he killed all\nof Sauron's werewolves until Sauron himself came out, knowing of the\nprophesy about Huan's death he took the shape of the greatest wolf that\nhad ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat\nhim, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while\nLúthien and Beren went on their way back to Doriath, they came across\nCelegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by\nOrodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien,\nbut Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien.\nSpeaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to\ngain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf\nDraugluin and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger Thuringwethil. Using\nthese skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan\nhunted in the wild. After Beren and Lúthien had won the Silmaril but\nBeren had lost his hand to the werewolf Carcharoth, Huan joined Beren,\nThingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung in the Hunt for the Wolf. Huan and\nBeren managed to kill Carcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded.\nSpeaking for the third and last time, he wished Beren and Lúthien\nfarewell, and died. Etymology _HUAN_ literally means “great dog, hound”,\nderiving from the Sindarin _hû_ (“hound”). In Quenya, Huan also means\n“hound”, which comes from the word _khugan_ or _hunen_. Other versions\nin the legendarium In earlier texts, Huan was described to be the\n“Captain of Dogs” and a rival to Tevildo (later Sauron), the Prince of\nCats. Here, Huan met Tinuviel (Lúthien), who was initially afraid and\nfled from him. With his speed Huan overtook her in two leaps and spoke\n“soft and deep the tongue of the Lost Elves”.",

    "text": "BARAHIR was an Edain Man of Dorthonion during the First Age, heir to the\nHouse of Bëor, youngest son and last child of Bregor, the fifth\nchieftain of the People of Bëor, and husband of Emeldir who was also of\nthe House of Bëor through the line of Belen, the youngest son of Bëor.\nBarahir was most famous for being the father of the renowned Beren\nErchamion. He was also the fourth Lord of Ladros and the seventh and\nprobably last Chieftain of the Bëorians after his deceased elder brother\nBregolas. Besides his elder brother, Barahir had three elder\nsisters: _Bregil_, _Hirwen_, and _Gilwen_.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarlier, Barahir had fought at the Dagor Bragollach, saving Finrod\nFelagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the House of\nFinarfin. For this, he received “Barahir's Ring”, which was then handed\ndown the family line. After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456, Barahir\nlived with twelve companions on the highland of Dorthonion at Tarn\nAeluin as outlaws defying the will of Morgoth whose forces hunted him\nand his company like wild beasts. The members of Barahir's outlaw\nband was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the\nyounger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim _the\nUnhappy_, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir _the Young_. As for his wife\nEmeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women\nand children of Bëor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in\nthis, Barahir's wife was known as _Emeldir the Man-hearted_,\n\nFor five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when\nthey were betrayed to Sauron by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's\noutlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin along with everyone in\nhis company save for Beren his son who was gone on an errand for them\nand thus luckily happened to be not there. Barahir's remains were buried\nin a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin save for his hand which was chopped\noff by an Orc captain of Morgoth. Beren later slew that Orc-captain and\nrecovered the renowned Ring of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped\nDorthonion after all and lived on to fulfill a great destiny.\n\nLegacy\n\nBarahir's service to Finrod and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy\nof respect between the House of Bëor, later generations of Men, and\nElves. This friendship led to the close association of the elves and the\nDúnedain of Númenor and Arnor and Gondor. His ring also became an\nheirloom of the Dúnedain of the North of Middle-earth.\n\n\nLater namesakes\n\nBarahir was also the name of the eighth Steward of Gondor and was also\nthe name of the grandson of Faramir and Éowyn in the Fourth Age, who\nwrote _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThe character of Barahir evolved out of the character Egnor bo-Rimion\n(see _The Book of Lost Tales_ and _Beren and Lúthien_ novel). In the\noriginal Barahir was originally a Gnome, an Elf. The Tale of Tinúviel\nsaw a 1925 (and later) edit that changed Egnor into Barahir a Noldoli\nElf. At some point the character evolved into a Man. However, its noted\nin _'Beren and Luthien_ that the in the original pre-1917 transcript\nwhich J.R.R. Tolkien erased and wrote over that Beren was originally a\nMan, before he rewrote the character as an Elf, and would go back to\nmaking him a Man in _Lay of Leithian_ (though the narrative included in\nthe new novel has Beren switching between both races depending on the\nsection documents).",

    "text": "MANDOS (Quenya; IPA: - “Prison-Fortress”) is an Ainu, one of the Aratar\nand a Vala who is responsible for the judgement of the Spirits, or Fëa\nof all Elven dead. He also has responsibility for pronouncing the dooms\nand judgments of Eru Ilúvatar under Manwë. His real name is NÁMO\n(Quenya; IPA: “Ordainer” or “Judge”) but was later known by the Elves as\nMandos after his sacred Halls of Mandos, over which he presides and\nwhere ultimately the Elves go after they are slain. Mandos was the sixth\ngreatest of the Lords of the Valar, and fifth greatest Aratar. Biography\nMandos was the brother of Irmo (Lórien) and Nienna in the mind of Eru\nIlúvatar. He and his brother Lórien are the Fëanturi, the MASTERS OF\nSPIRITS. His wife was Vaire the Weaver. He it was who pronounced Manwë's\nDoom concerning the espousals of the Eldar on YT 1172, when Finwë asked\ncounsel for a second marriage, after the death of his wife's passing to\nthe Halls of Mandos. When Melkor began marring Arda before the coming of\nthe Elves, Tulkas arrived and wanted to make war swiftly. At the bidding\nof Manwë, Mandos pronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the\ncaptivity of Melkor, Mandos had once again pronounced the Doom. Melkor\nspent three Ages in the duress of Mandos thereafter, guarded by his\nhound Gorgumoth in Lumbi. Mandos judged Fëanor to leave Tirion for\ntwelve years after Fëanor's drawing of sword against Fingolfin. After\nthe destruction of the Two Trees, Yavanna asked for the light of the\nSilmarils, which Fëanor denied and he shall be slain, the first in Aman;\nbut Mandos had spoken and revealed that Finwë was the first, having been\nslain at the steps of Formenos by Melkor. When the Ñoldor revolted\nagainst the Valar, Mandos appeared before them and pronounced the Doom\nof the Ñoldor. Only once has he been moved to pity, when Lúthien sang of\nthe grief she and her lover Beren had experienced in Beleriand. Then,\nwith the Elder King's approval, he released them to Middle-earth to\nbegin their second life there as mortal beings with no certitude of\nlife. When Eärendil arrived in Aman to beg for assistance from the\nValar, Mandos considered Eärendil and Elwing's fate as Half-elven and\ngave them and their descendants a choice: either to be counted among\nElves or Men. Character Mandos, upon appearing before the Ñoldor, was\nreferred to be a dark figure with a loud voice, solemn and terrible. He\nwas described as being stern, dispassionate and never forgetting a\nthing. He was the Vala who cursed the Ñoldor leaving Aman, and\ncounselled against allowing them to return. But unlike Morgoth, his\nDooms are not cruel or vindictive by his own design. They are simply the\nwill of Eru, and he will not speak them unless he is commanded to do so\nby Manwë. Etymology His common name _MANDOS_ means “Prison-fortress”. It\nstems from _Mandost_ (“castle of custody”) or _mbando_ (“custody”) and\n_osto_ (“fortified building or place”). His real name, NÁMO, means\n“Ordainer” or “Judge” in Quenya. Other Names The Old English translation\nfor Mandos is NEFREA “Corpse-ruler” from _neo_ (“corpse”) and _frea_\n(“lord”). His title is NEOAERNA HLAFORD (“Master of the houses of the\ndead”). He was also called MORIMANDO, the “Dark Mando”, as opposed to\nManwë's _Kalamando_, the “Light Mando”. In Tolkien's earlier work,\nMandos was named VEFANTUR. Other versions of the legendarium As\nVefantur, his wife was Fui Nienna and together they were called the\n“Gods of Death”. Their halls were located beneath the roots of the\nMountains of Valinor.",

    "text": "UINEN (Quenya; IPA: - “No Water”) was a Maia spirit known as _THE LADY\nOF THE SEA_ and the wife of the Maia Ossë, and she was also a patron to\nall mariners.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBefore the Sun and the Moon\n\nUinen loves all creatures that lived in the saltwater streams of the\nworld and the weeds that grew in them. Her love calmed the violent tidal\nwaves and storms created by Ossë her husband by keeping him in line and\nnot going too far. Her hair spread throughout waters and lies on their\nsurfaces. During the early days Arda, Ossë rebelled against his Lord\nUlmo (_Lord of All Waters_) and served Melkor instead, being carried\naway by the false promises that Melkor gave to him. From then on, for a\nwhile, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to\nthe lands. At that point, and also because of the prayers of Aulë who\ncreated those lands, Uinen helped bring Ossë back to the allegiance of\ntheir lord Ulmo by restraining her husand and bringing him before Ulmo.\nFollowing that, Uinen's husband was pardoned and gave his allegiance\nback to the Valar remaining thereafter faithful then ever to them. To\nthe Maiar Uinen and Ossë, Ulmo their lord gave them the task of the\ngoverning of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Plus ever\nafterwards, Uinen was the one who restrained her Spouse's violence in\nthe seas and on the coasts.\n\nLater on, the Teleri remained long on the coast of the western seas,\nawaiting still for Ulmo to take them to Aman. Likewise, Uinen and Ossë\ncame among the Teleri at the coasts and befriended them. In addition,\nthe Teleri had much love for Uinen and her spouse, for Uinen and Ossë\ncontinued being friends with the Teleri who then dwelt by the mouths of\nthe great river Sirion of Beleriand which flowed into the sea.\nUltimately, the Teleri with their King Olwë at last reached Aman where\nthey built their dwelling as a city-haven named 'Alqualondë' on the\nshores of Eldamar in Aman. However later on, the 'Kinslaying at\nAlqualondë' took place at the Swanhaven of the Teleri where Fëanor,\neldest son of King Finwë of the Ñoldor, and his host of exiled Ñoldor\nattacked the Teleri and forcefully stole their white ships for their\nvoyage to Middle-earth. Notwithstanding though, Uinen wept for the many\nof the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the\nsea. What's more, the sea then rose in great wrath by Uinen against the\nNoldorin slayers in that so many of the Telerin ships were wrecked and\nthose of the Ñoldor in them were drowned.\n\nWhen the Hiding of Valinor took place, Ossë raised the enchanted Isles.\nThen next, Uinen enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by\nweaving them in her hair before Irmo (_Master of Dreams & Desires_) put\nthem to age-long sleep.\n\nSecond Age\n\nDuring the Second Age, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Uinen for\nhelp, because she was the only one capable of calming Ossë who loved to\ncreate tumults in the seas, And the Númenóreans lived under her\nprotection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the\nNúmenóreans held the Maia Uinen in reverence as equal to the Valar.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn a Númenórean legend, it was told that Uinen had the Isle of Tol Uinen\nplaced in the Bay of Rómenna as a gift to the people of Númenór.\n\nIn the original story of the Sun and the Moon, it was Uinen herself who\nwove the sails for the ship of the Moon. Uinen had made them as white\nmists and foam and some were spread like glittering scales of silver\nfish while others were threaded with tiny stars looking like points of\nlight.",

    "text": "THÉODEN was the seventeenth King of Rohan, and last of the Second Line\nof the royal house of House of Eorl.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarlier Years\n\nThéoden was the only son of Thengel, and became king after the death of\nhis father in TA 2980. Théoden spoke Sindarin and Westron more often\nthan Rohirric, due to the influence of his father, and spent a part of\nhis youth growing up in the mountain vales of Gondor, his mother's\nhomeland.\n\nHis sister Théodwyn lived with him in Edoras, and after she and her\nhusband both died he adopted her children Éomer and Éowyn as his own. He\nhad a son Théodred, whose mother Elfhild died in childbirth.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden had been king for nearly 40\nyears, and was becoming old and tired. He was increasingly misled by his\nchief adviser Gríma (or _Wormtongue_ as most others in the Mark called\nhim), who was secretly in the employ of Saruman the White. Gríma may\neven have been poisoning Théoden. In the last years before the War of\nthe Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands, and Gríma gained\nan increasingly large hold over him. Rohan was troubled again by Orcs\nand Dunlendings as well as the new fighting Uruk-hai, who operated under\nthe will of Saruman, ruling from Isengard.\n\nWhen Théoden's son Théodred was mortally wounded at a battle at the\nFords of Isen in skirmish with the Orcs of Saruman, his nephew Éomer\nbecame his heir. Éomer fell out of favor with Wormtongue and was\neventually banished from Rohan.\n\nWhen Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli appeared before him,\nThéoden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after\nbeing released from the effects of Gríma, he commanded Hama to release\nhis nephew and bring him his sword, and led the Riders of Rohan into\nbattle against Saruman but having found that Saruman's forces had broken\nthrough Rohan's outer defenses. Théoden, under advice from Gandalf,\nretreated and fought against Saruman's hordes at the Battle of Helm's\nDeep. After this, he became known as THÉODEN EDNEW, the Renewed, because\nhe had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.\n\nBefore the battle, Théoden had made a favorite of Merry, and expressed\ngreat interest in hearing more about The Shire, especially Hobbits' lore\nsurrounding pipe-weed. He led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields bravely charging the legions of Sauron,\nwhere he won great glory by defeating “The Black Serpent,” a chieftain\nof the Southrons, in single combat.\n\n\n\nHe challenged the Witch-king of the Nine Ringwraiths, and was\nunconscious when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by\nthe Ringwraith's fell beast. He was quickly protected by his niece Éowyn\nand the Hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck both of whom had ridden to war in\nsecret.\n\nTheoden's wounds were mortal and he perished on the plains of Pelennor.\nHis body was preserved in the Hallows of Minas Tirith until Eomer\nreturned to Rohan, and Theoden was buried in Edoras.\n\nAfter his death, a Rohirrim minstrel Gléowine composed a song for him\nand the other Kings of Rohan.\n\n Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising he rode singing in the\nsun, sword unsheathing. Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended; over\ndeath, over dread, over doom lifted out of loss, out of life, unto long\nglory.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _THÉODEN_ is taken from the Anglo-Saxon word _þeoden_, meaning\n“lord”. It is related to the Old Norse word _þjóðann_, meaning “leader\nof the people” (i.e. “King”).\n\nIt might have been translated from the original Rohirric TÛRAC, an old\nword for “king”.",

    "text": "FINWË was the first High King of the Ñoldor who led his people on the\njourney from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman. He\nwas a great friend of Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath. He was the\nfather of Fëanor, Fingolfin, Finarfin, Írimë, and Findis. As founder of\nthe House of Finwë, he and his first and second wives were the sires of\nthe three noble houses of Fëanor, Fingolfin, Finarfin who afterwards\nruled great realms in Middle-earth, and succeeded him in Aman. His\nbloodline also mixed its way into the race of Men as well.\n\nFinwë was perhaps one of the firstborn Elves (created solely from Eru\nIlúvatar himself) who awoke in Cuiviénen.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFinwë was born or perhaps awoke in Middle-earth in the far eastern land\nof Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees. When the Vala Oromë found\nthe Elves during his travels in Middle-earth, he loved them and urged\nthem to travel with him to Valinor to see its wondrous beauty. The Elves\nhowever, were suspicious of this call and were afraid and so Oromë chose\nambassadors to represent the three Elven-kindreds: the Vanyar, the\nÑoldor, and the Teleri, to represent their kindreds and to return and\nreport what they had saw. One of them was Finwë who along with Ingwë and\nElwë went to the Blessed Realm with Oromë. When they returned, they were\nable to convince the Elves to go on the Great Journey into the far West.\n\nThere was great friendship between Finwë of the Ñoldor and Elwë of the\nTeleri. Then each became leaders of their own Elven-kindred. Thus, Finwë\nbecame the Lord of the Ñoldor who led his people on the Great Journey.\nAnd eventually, Finwë and his people the Ñoldor arrived in Valinor\ndirectly behind the Vanyar. There he and his people settled and Finwë\nthus became the _First High King of the Ñoldor_.\n\n\n\nFinwë started a family first marrying Míriel Serindë who had also come\nwith her people the Ñoldor to Aman. They had a son called Fëanor but her\nlabors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she\ndied shortly after bearing him. After a period of mourning he married\nagain. His second wife was Indis of the Vanyar. Indis bore him four\nchildren: Fingolfin, Finarfin, Findis, and Irimë.\n\nWhen Melkor, now free from the Halls of Mandos began spreading lies\namongst the Ñoldor attempting to corrupt them, Finwë attempted to\nmoderate his people and lead them back to the Valar. But it was too\nlate, the Ñoldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and\nnew dominions they could have ruled back in Middle-earth and were proud.\nHowever, Fëanor mistrusted the Valar and believed the lies and began to\nhorde his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons\nto see the Silmarils. He also begun to suspect his half-brother was\ntrying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Tirion\ndrawing his sword on Fingolfin. For this he was banished from the city,\nbut Finwë loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile and went with\nhim northward and built the city/fortress of Formenos.\n\nThere Finwë lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the\nrest of his house. Later, when Fëanor was summoned to Valmar to make\npeace with his brother, Finwë did not go out of bitterness over the\nexile of his son nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because\nhe no longer felt like their king. There he was the first to be killed\nin Valinor when Melkor slew him at the doors of Formenos seeking the\nSilmarils. This act was the catalyst that led to the Revolt of the\nÑoldor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nFinwë's name is not fully translated. The glossary in the Silmarillion\ntranslates _Fin_ as “hair”; other sources say it means “skill”.",

In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by\nCold-drakes, his father Dáin I and younger brother Frór were both slain\nat their gates by a great Cold-Drake, and Thrór inherited the kingship.\nHe and his youngest brother Grór resolved to divide their folk: Thrór\nled a small portion of the House of Durin to recolonize Erebor where\nthey rediscovered the Arkenstone. Grór led a greater portion of Durin's\nFolk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his Dwarven realm.\nUnder Thrór's leadership, Erebor prospered for over a century.\nEventually the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the\ndragon known as Smaug, who flew south and destroyed the kingdom, killing\nhundreds of Dwarves and driving away Thrór and his family, as well as\nthousands of other surviving dwarves. The majority of the survivors\nmigrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Thrór, his son Thráin\nII, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield west into a long and homeless\nwandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Dunland where they\nmade a living as best they could.\n\nTwenty years later in TA 2790, Thrór now old, poor, and desperate, gave\nto his son Thráin II the last of the Seven Rings and a map of the Lonely\nMountain. He then left his people and journeyed away north with a single\ncompanion called Nár. They crossed over the Misty Mountains through the\nRedhorn Pass and then came south again, crossing the Silverlode into the\nvalley of Azanulbizar beneath the East Gate of Moria. When they arrived,\nthe gate was open. Nár begged Thrór to beware but Thrór disregarded his\npleas and proudly entered Moria as its returning heir, but he did not\ncome back.\n\nNár waited and hid nearby for many days. One day he heard a great shout,\nfollowed by the blast of a horn, and a body was flung out onto the\nsteps. It was indeed the body of Thrór, as Nár had feared. Then a voice\ncalled out to him from just inside the gate. Rather than being killed as\nwell, Nár was instead made use of as a messenger. He was told to deliver\na warning that 'beggars' who would not wait at the doors but instead\nentered to attempt thieving, would meet a similar fate. Nár was told to\nbring this message back to his people. But that was not all: the voice\nproclaimed that he now ruled Moria, and if any wanted to know who was\nking, he had written his name on the beggar's face. Thrór's head lay\nsevered next to his body. Nár turned it over and found branded across\nthe forehead, written in Dwarven runes, a name that would be branded in\nthe hearts of all Dwarves: Azog. He was barred from retrieving the head\nof Thrór and was struck with a pouch containing a few coins of little\nworth, which Azog referred to as a 'fee', but it was meant as a final\ninsulting gesture. Nár took the pouch and fled down the Silverlode. When\nhe looked back, Orcs had emerged from the gate and were hacking apart\nThrór's body and flinging the pieces to the black crows.\n\nThis was the tale that Nár brought back to Thráin II when he returned to\nDunland weeks later. After seven days of sitting in silent grief, Thráin\nat last stood up and declared that this atrocity would be answered. This\nwas the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, although it took\nup three years for the Dwarves to gather their full forces. Several\nyears later, Dain Ironfoot, son of Náin, beheaded Azog and mounted the\nOrc's head on a stick. The pouch of coins was stuffed into Azog's mouth.\nThorin, Thrór's grandson, hated Azog ever since.",

    "text": "BOMBUR was a Dwarf who accompanies Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo\nBaggins on their journey to the Lonely Mountain. His brother Bofur and\ncousin Bifur also were part of the company.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned\nare his brother Bofur and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's\nline although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is\nalso unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to\nErebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of\nthe 13 “by some fifty years” and that after Thorin had been captured,\nBalin was “the eldest left”. Since Fíli was born in TA 2859 and Balin\nwas born in TA 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and\n2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the\nquest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue\nMountains with Thorin after the loss of Thráin II.\n\nThe Quest for Erebor\n\n\n\nBombur is the twelfth Dwarf to arrive at Bag End. Because he counts for\ntwo, he is the last to enter Beorn's house and the last to cross the\nEnchanted river in Mirkwood. Bombur is first introduced when he tumbles\nwith Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they enter Bag End, and he also is\nknocked into the Enchanted river (and falls asleep). He chooses to stay\nand guard the camp, and supplies while the others move up the Lonely\nMountain because he trusts neither mountain paths nor ropes. Later\nthough, he is forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon\nSmaug.\n\nBombur sleeps at several key moments in the book. When he is violently\nknocked into the Mirkwood River by an aggressive stag, he falls under a\nspell that makes him sleep for days, burdening the others with his\nweight as they walked on. While he is on a midnight lookout in the\nfortified Lonely Mountain, Bilbo promises to keep watch so that he can\nsleep a bit longer and take another watch later (Bilbo used this\nopportunity to sneak the Arkenstone out of the mountain). Incidentally,\nhe was asleep when they opened his barrel after escaping the Elves of\nMirkwood and also when Bilbo discovered the secret entrance to Lonely\nMountain. Bombur is always last and doesn't enjoy it. When the Dwarves,\nGandalf, and Bilbo meet Beorn, Bombur comes last. He comes along\nstraight after Bifur and Bofur so he won't be last. He fought at and\nsurvived the Battle of the Five Armies. Following the defeat of Smaug,\nDain II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure and he remained to\nlive at the Lonely Mountain.\n\nLater Years\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_, many years later, Frodo Baggins inquires\nafter Bombur and learns that he has grown so fat it takes several\nDwarves to lift him to the dinner table. It is unlikely that Bombur\nfought in the Battle of Dale due to his over weight.\n\n\nWeapons and abilities\n\nIn Peter Jackson's Hobbit film trilogy, Bombur can be seen using a\nnumber of different weapons and tools to fight off enemies. His primary\nweapon is an iron ladle, which he wields during _An Unexpected Journey_.\nHe also uses a cleaver or butcher's knife to slash enemies. In _The\nDesolation of Smaug_, he uses the same weapons but usually wields an\naxe. Of course, his greatest weapon is his size which he uses to crush\nand bounce away opponents. Bombur and his family are not classically\ntrained fighters but are lethal with any sort of tool in their hands.\n\nHe also is surprisingly agile for a dwarf of his size and weight. He is\nvery capable of performing stunts such as when, in the second film, he\npole vaults into a barrel. He has an astonishing degree of durability,\nand can withstand a hard landing on a great number of Orcs, and also\nabsorbs an incredible amount of momentum in the process, without\nbreaking a limb or causing himself any visible degree of injury. In\naddition, he is a quick thinker and uses his ingenuity frequently to\nhelp push past Orcs or leap across gaps.",

    "text": "AZOG, known also as the DEFILER and THE PALE ORC,''' '''was an orc who\nlived in the Third Age. He commanded the tribes of Moria from TA 2790\nuntil his death in TA 2799. He was responsible for the death of King\nThror and for King Thrain's madness.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAzog was a powerful orc who claimed rulership over the abandoned\nDwarvish mines of Moria during the Third Age. He became the leader of\nthe Goblins of Moria and initiated the War of the Dwarves and Orcs in TA\n2790 by beheading King Thrór, who had come to revisit the ruins of the\nancient dwarven kingdom of Moria. At some point he had a son named Bolg.\nIn the following years, Azog was the common enemy of all dwarves, and\nthe war he started had its climax in the Battle of Azanulbizar, where he\nkilled Náin, only to be himself slain by Náin's son Dáin, who would\nlater become King of Durin's Folk. His son, Bolg, inherited the reign in\nMoria and continued it for decades until his death at the Battle of the\nFive Armies.  Azog entered history in the year\nTA 2790 due to King Thrór's desire to revisit and perhaps restore the\nlost realm of Khazad-dûm. When Thrór was found in the armories of\nKhazad-dûm, he was brought before Azog, being accused of thieving. He\ntortured Thrór for two days until he was informed of a second dwarf\noutside of Moria. He decided to kill Thrór after he defied him with the\nwords “These are the Halls of Durin!” He beheaded Thrór and carved his\nname in Thrór's head, then threw Thrór's body over the stairs. Azog then\ncalled out to Nar, the other dwarf, from the gate, demanding that he\ndeliver a message back to Thrór's people, warning that beggars who dared\nto enter Moria and attempted thievery would meet a similar fate.\n\nAzog then called out that he had killed Thrór , and that he now ruled\nMoria as king. His name in runes was carved onto the brow of Thrór,\nforever branding it into the hearts of the Dwarves. Nár was barred from\nretrieving the head of Thrór, and the orcs threw him a small pouch of\ncoins of little worth as a final gesture of scorn. Nár took the pouch,\nturned, and fled. When he looked back, orcs had emerged from the gate\nand were hacking apart Thrór's body and flinging the pieces as carrion\nfor the ravens.\n\nWhen news of this reached Thrór's heir Thráin, he was greatly angered\nand mustered a force of Dwarves from the House of Durin and others to\nseek revenge on Azog, though it took three years to muster their\nDwarves. So began the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. The Dwarves hunted\nAzog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth. After nine years\nof war, before the gates of Moria itself, the climactic Battle of\nAzanulbizar was fought. In that battle, Azog was pursued through the\nGates of Moria, killed, and beheaded by Dáin, son of Náin. His head was\nimpaled on a stake, and the pouch of coins he had thrown to Nár was\nstuffed into his mouth.\n\nExcept for Thrain, the Dwarves made no attempt to press their advantage\nby pursuing the orcs into the mines, many of them having been slain.\nThey warned Thrain against entering Moria. Dáin had glimpsed Durin's\nBane deep within and warned the Dwarves to not attempt entering\nMoria. Azog's underground realm's population had been greatly reduced\nin the war and his reign passed to his son Bolg for the next 150 years,\nuntil Bolg's death in the Battle of the Five Armies.\n\n\nOther Mentions\n\nAzog is mentioned briefly in _The Hobbit_ by Gandalf, who says to\nThorin, “Your grandfather Thrór was killed, you remember, in the mines\nof Moria by Azog the Goblin,” to which Thorin responds “Curse his name,\nyes”.\n\nIncidentally, this is the only place that Tolkien refers to Azog as a\n“goblin”; in other books such as _The Lord of the Rings_, Tolkien\ndescribes him as a “great Orc.” This is not a discrepancy, however,\nsince as far as Tolkien was concerned, _goblin_ is merely the English\ntranslation of the word _orc,_ not a different type of creature, and in\n_The Hobbit_ he almost always referred to orcs as goblins.",

He is best known for his deeds during\nthe events of _The Hobbit_ and the War of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nGwaihir was descended from Thorondor, the greatest Eagle who ever lived.\nIt was said that he and his brother Landroval aided Thorondor in\nrescuing Beren and Luthien from Angband.\n\nAt some point in his life, Gandalf the Grey saved him from a poisoned\narrow.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nIn the summer of TA 3018, Gandalf asked Radagast the Brown to send word\namong his friends the birds to learn what they could of the Enemy's\nplans. The Great Eagles flew far and wide and gathered news of the\nNazgûl and the mustering of Orcs and Wargs, and of the escape of Gollum\nfrom Mirkwood.\n\n[Gwaihir rescues Gandalf from Orthanc.]\n\nGwaihir went to Isengard to bring this news to Gandalf. In the early\nhours of September 18, he found Gandalf imprisoned by Saruman on the\npinnacle of Orthanc. Gwaihir bore Gandalf away, and when the Wizard said\nthat he needed a horse, Gwaihir set him down in the land of Rohan.\n\nOn February 17, 3019, Gwaihir was searching for Gandalf at the request\nof Galadriel when he found the Wizard atop the Silvertine. Gandalf had\nvanquished the Balrog in the Battle of the Peak, but the entrance to the\nEndless Stair had been blocked and he had been unable to escape from the\nmountaintop. Gwaihir once again bore Gandalf and he found his burden to\nbe as light as a feather, for Gandalf's old life had been burned away\nand he had been reborn as Gandalf the White.\n\nThe Eagle brought Gandalf to Lothlórien and then at the Wizard's request\nhe flew to seek news of the Fellowship. Aragorn and Legolas both saw him\ncircling above the Emyn Muil. Gwaihir returned to Gandalf with the news\nthat Merry and Pippin had been captured by Saruman's Uruk-hai.\n\n\n\nGwaihir and his brother Landroval led a great company of Eagles to the\nBattle of the Black Gate on March 25, 3019. They swooped in to attack\nthe Winged Nazgûl, but the Nazgûl fled when Sauron summoned them to fly\nto Mount Doom where Frodo Baggins stood at the Cracks of Doom with the\nRing. After the Ring was destroyed, Mount Doom erupted and Frodo and Sam\nwere stranded on a hill amid flowing lava and falling ash. Gandalf asked\nGwaihir to bear him a final time. Accompanied by Landroval and Meneldor,\nGwaihir raced swiftly to Mount Doom and with his keen sight, he spotted\nthe Hobbits through the fumes. The Eagles lifted Frodo and Sam and bore\nthem away to safety.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _GWAIHIR_ comes from the Sindarin terms _gwaew_ (“storm, wind”)\nand _hîr_ (“lord, master”), translating his name to “Wind-lord”.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nGwaihir had keen eyesight and was the swiftest of the Great Eagles. He\nwas large and strong enough to carry a grown man. Gwaihir was\nintelligent and was capable of speech.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _The History of Middle-earth_\n-   ''The Hobbit ''\n-   ''The Fellowship of the Ring ''\n-   ''The Two Towers ''\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_\n-   ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ''\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier versions, his name was “Gwaewar” and he was Thorodor's (then\nleader of the Great Eagles) vassal. As Gwaewar, he was called the “Lord\nof the Wind”. He was also among the Eagles present to save Beren and\nLúthien from Angband.\n\nIn TA 2941, a character called “Lord of the Eagles” saved Thorin and\nCompany from Wargs and Orcs. He later arrived in the Lonely Mountain and\nfought in the Battle of Five Armies.\n\nHowever, it is up for debate if Gwaihir was one of the eagles that saved\nThorin and Company. In the whole _Lord of the Rings_ Gwaihir carries\nGandalf twice, and by the end of the book Gandalf says that Gwaihir had\ncarried him twice; this implies that Gwaihir never carried him before\nthe timeframe of the book.",

He was succeeded as King of\nDale by his son, Bain.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nBard was descended from Lord Girion of Dale, whose wife and child had\nescaped to Laketown when Smaug ruined Dale and took the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770.\n\nIn TA 2941, when Smaug emerged from the Lonely Mountain and attacked\nLaketown, Bard, as captain of a company of town archers, was encouraging\nthe archers and urging the town Master to order them to fight to the\nlast arrow. Bard himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He\nwas down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched on his\nshoulder. Because Bard was of the race of Dale, he was able to\nunderstand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in\nSmaug's armor that Bilbo Baggins had discovered. Bard fired his Black\nArrow and struck the hollow by Smaug's left breast and the dragon fell\nfrom the sky, landing on Laketown and destroying it.\n\nBard escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be\ntheir King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of\nLaketown for the time being. Bard took charge of organizing shelter and\naid for the refugees and sent messages to the Elvenking of Mirkwood\nasking for help. Then, Bard and the Elvenking led their armies to the\nLonely Mountain, seeking a share of the treasure.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, they were surprised to find\nThorin Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves still alive. Bard sought\nreparations from Thorin on the grounds that it was he who had slain\nSmaug, that part of the Dragon’s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and\nthat the people of Laketown were suffering and needed aid. Thorin said\nthat the destruction of Laketown was not his responsibility and he\nrefused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Bard sent a\nmessenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure,\nbut again Thorin refused.\n\n\n\nBilbo Baggins thought that Bard's claims were reasonable, so one night\nhe went secretly to the camp of the Lakemen and Elves. The Hobbit had\nfound the Arkenstone - the treasure that Thorin most desired - and he\noffered it to Bard and Thranduil to use to negotiate. He also told them\nthat an army of 500 Dwarves led by Dain II Ironfoot was coming from the\nIron Hills.\n\nThe next day, Bard asked Thorin for a portion of the treasure in\nexchange for the Arkenstone. Thorin was enraged, but he reluctantly\nagreed to give up Bilbo's one-fourteenth share. Dain's army arrived the\nnext day, and Bard tried to prevent them from entering the Lonely\nMountain until the exchange for the Arkenstone had been made. A battle\nseemed imminent, but then Gandalf told them that an army of Goblins and\nWargs were approaching. Bard, Thranduil, and Dain took council together\nand they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of the\nFive Armies. During the battle, Thorin had emerged from the mountain and\nhad rallied Dwarves, Elves, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally\nwounded. Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Thorin's breast when he was\nburied under the mountain, and Dain agreed to pay the one-fourteenth\nshare of the treasure as promised. Bard gave the emeralds of Girion to\nThranduil and Bilbo agreed to take a small chest of gold and one of\nsilver. Bard also contributed gold for the aid of Laketown, and although\nthe Master of Laketown absconded with much of it, Laketown was rebuilt\nand its people became prosperous.\n\nBard went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Lonely\nMountain. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of\nDale. Bard maintained good relations with the Dwarves of the Lonely\nMountain and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running. People\ncame to settle in Dale from miles around and the land that had been\nwithered by Smaug became bountiful once more.\n\nBard died in TA 2977. His son Bain succeeded him as King of Dale.",

He lived during the First Age of the Sun in Middle-earth,\nand was a lord of the hidden Elven kingdom of Gondolin. He became\ninfamous for his betrayal of the location of the city of Gondolin to the\nDark Lord Morgoth.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAredhel had left Gondolin to wander through Beleriand, and in the woods\nof Nan Elmoth, she met Eöl, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth\nto Maeglin. Eöl gave his child the name _Maeglin_ when he was twelve.\nHis mother told him about Gondolin and its people throughout his\nchildhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He\nand his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan\nElmoth and Eöl's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel\nfinally decided to leave Eöl, she took her son (who stole his father's\nsword, Anguirel, forged of meteoric iron) with her and returned to\nGondolin. However, Eöl had followed her, and in judgment before Turgon,\nhe attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel\ninstead. She died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city\nwalls.\n\nMaeglin was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin\nboth learned and taught much. He became an elven-prince held in high\nesteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals\nin the Echoriath surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel\nstronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named\n_Anghabar_, “Iron Mine”. In the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Maeglin refused to\nremain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon. The\nseventh and final gate of Gondolin, the Great Gate of Steel, was\nMaeglin's creation.\n\nEven though Maeglin was one of the mighty of Gondolin, his greatest\ndesire was to take Turgon's daughter Idril to be his wife. But his\ndesire was in vain, for Idril was his own first cousin, and as such was\nconsidered by Elven society to be too close in kinship with Maeglin to\nallow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Idril was well aware\nof Maeglin's thought concerning her and despised him for it.\n\nWhen Tuor came, carrying Ulmo's warning of the danger to Gondolin,\nMaeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. The\narguments made by Maeglin were instrumental in convincing Turgon not to\nleave Gondolin despite Ulmo's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the\nnear-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Tuor\nand Idril were wed and Idril bore a son, Eärendil, further increasing\nMaeglin's hate. Some time later, Maeglin was captured by orcs while\nseeking for metals outside of the Encircling Mountains. He was brought\nto Angband and taken before Morgoth himself, who knew that Maeglin dwelt\nin Gondolin and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Maeglin\nwith unimaginable torment, and though Maeglin was no craven, he was\ncowed by Morgoth's threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of\nGondolin in exchange for his freedom. Morgoth was overjoyed to obtain\nthis information, and to further encourage Maeglin and ensure both his\nsilence and his further aid, Morgoth promised him both rule of the city\nand the hand of Idril once Turgon was overthrown. Maeglin assented\neagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Morgoth released him and he\nreturned to Gondolin without suspicion. When the hosts of Morgoth\nattacked and overran the city, Maeglin sought to capture Idril and\nfought with Tuor on the walls. But Tuor prevailed, and threw him from\nthe wall to his death.\n\nMaeglin was a relatively young elf, being merely 190 years old at the\ntime of his death.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ÎON_ was the first name given to Maeglin, by Eöl, which simply meant\n'son'.  His later and common name _Maeglin_ means “sharp glance” in\nSindarin, with _Maeg_ (in Quenya _maika_) meaning 'sharp, piercing' and\n_glin_ meaning 'gleam'. At birth, Aredhel secretly gave Maeglin the name\nof _LÓMION_, signifying “Child of the Twilight” in the Quenya tongue.\n\n_MORLEG_ was the original and rejected name for him, as found in _The\nWar of the Jewels_.",

With\nthem, they took the _Palantiri_, the “Seeing Stones” that were given to\nthe Lords of Andúnie by the elves of Tol Eressëa, and a seedling of\nNimloth, the White Tree of Númenor.\n\nAs he landed on Middle-earth Elendil proclaimed in Quenya: _Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta_ - “Out\nof the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide,\nand my heirs, unto the ending of the world.” His heir and\n89-great-grandson Aragorn spoke these traditional words again when he\ntook up the crown of Gondor at the beginning of the Fourth Age.\n\nElendil lived in Arnor, where he founded the city of Annúminas. His son\nAnárion founded the city of Minas Anor in Anórien, and his son Isildur\nfounded Minas Ithil in Ithilien. Across the Anduin, the city of\nOsgiliath was built. Across the realms towers were built for the\n_Palantíri_, with which the realms kept contact.\n\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men\n\n\n\nIn time Sauron returned to Middle-earth, establishing a stronghold in\nMordor, next to Gondor. In SA 3428, he attacked seizing Minas Ithil.\nIsildur fled north to his father, leaving Anárion in charge of Gondor.\nIn SA 3434, Elendil and Isildur returned south together with the Elven\nHigh King Gil-galad and their combined armies, in the Last Alliance of\nElves and Men.\n\nAfter defeating Sauron's armies and advancing into Mordor itself, the\narmies of Men and Elves settled into a siege of the main tower of\nSauron: Barad-dûr. During this siege Anárion was killed.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the long siege in the year SA 3441, Sauron came out to\npersonally do battle with his enemies. Elendil, together with the\nElven-king Gil-galad, overthrew Sauron, but they were both killed in the\nprocess, and Elendil's sword broke when he fell.\n\nElendil's son Isildur used his father's broken sword to cut the One Ring\nfrom Sauron's hand. Vanquished, Sauron's spirit fled. Isildur built a\nhidden tomb for his father on the summit of the beacon hill of\nHalifirien.\n\nLegacy\n\nLeading the remnant of The Faithful Númenóreans to Middle-earth, Elendil\nestablished strong regimes there and created the great alliance that put\nan end to Sauron's power for over a thousand years. His bloodline and\nspirited leadership survived in the Dúnedain of the North and South of\nMiddle-earth, that would in turn sire the brave and heroic Men that\nwould help bring a final end to Sauron in the War of the Ring.\n\nAragorn's battle-cry in the _The Lord of the Rings_ was _ELENDIL!._\n\nThe Oath of Elendil\n\nLyrics, in Quenya:\n_Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien\nSinome Maruvan\nar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-Metta_\n\nTranslation:\n_Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.\nIn this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the\nworld.'\"_\n\nThis oath was sung an age later by Aragorn II Elessar, during his\ncoronation at the end of the War of the Ring.",

    "text": "_For other uses of TREEBEARD see Treebeard (disambiguation)_\n\nTREEBEARD, also known as FANGORN, was the oldest of the Entsleft in\nMiddle-earth, an ancient tree-like being who is a “shepherd of trees”.\nHe has a very tall and stiff-limbed appearance, with bark-like skin and\nleafy hair.\n\nIn Chapter 5 of _The Two Towers_, Gandalf calls Treebeard “...the oldest\nliving thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth.”\nIn _The Return of the King_, chapter 6, “Many Partings”, Celeborn\naddresses Treebeard as “Eldest.”\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Third Age\n\nTreebeard was the oldest Ent who ever lived. He was so old that he\nremembered the time of Elves teaching the trees to speak, recalling how\nthey wanted to talk to everything. In the time when Middle-earth was\nmerely a giant forest, Treebeard roamed the land, presumably with his\nlove, Fimbrethil. But after the loss of the Entwives, he and the\nremaining Ents dwelt in the Forest of Fangorn, isolating themselves from\nthe outside world.\n\nThird Age and War of the Ring\n\n\n\nWith the arrival of the Istari in the year TA 1000 of the Third Age,\nSaruman came to Fangorn and befriended Treebeard, and would often visit\nhim. The two would talk, discussing various subjects, with Saruman\ngathering information about the forest itself, and in particular its\nintertwining paths.\n\nAs the years passed and with no Entings due to the loss of the Entwives,\nthe number of Ents fell. Some Ents in their old age became still and\nsilent, almost becoming tree like as they slumbered. Treebeard, Finglas,\nFladrif, Quickbeam and around fifty remained, some younger, some older.\nWhen Sauron's shadow began to spread across the land once more,\nTreebeard and the Ents remained in Fangorn, continuing to tend the\ntrees, and taking no part in the affairs of Men, Elves and Wizards.\nHowever, they were brought into the war when Meriadoc Brandybuck and\nPeregrin Took escaped from Saruman's Orcs, became lost in Fangorn Forest\nand befriended Treebeard. Upon learning that Saruman was cutting down\nthe forest to power his war effort, an angry Treebeard called all the\nents together for an Entmoot. After three days of deliberation, they\ndecided to attack Isengard, in an event known as the Last March of the\nEnts.\n\nLeading the attack, Treebeard helped to bring down Isengard's walls and\nutterly destroy them, save the tower of Orthanc and Saruman himself who\nsat in his tower with his manservant Grima Wormtongue. The Ents also\nbroke the dam wall which had starved the once green and beautiful\nWizards Vale of all its water, flooding Saruman's pits, mines, and\nmachines of war. Once Isengard was cleansed, Treebeard remained to guard\nover Saruman, but was ultimately unable to keep him, due to the power of\nSaruman's voice and the fact that Treebeard could not bear to lock any\nliving thing up.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and Beyond\n\nAfter Aragorn was crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents\ncould prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of Mordor\ngone, and renew their search for the Entwives.  However, Treebeard sadly\nlamented that forests may spread once more, but the Ents would not,\npredicting that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest\nuntil they slowly dwindled in number.  However, he still held some hope\nfor finding the Entwives, as he asked Merry and Pippin to watch for them\nnear the Shire, and to bring word if they were to find them.\n\nTreebeard's ultimate fate is not known.  While he aged very slowly and\nwas extremely long-lived, he was not immortal.  He most likely underwent\nthe same fate of all the Ents: eventually settling down in one place,\ngrowing roots and leaves, and essentially becoming a tree himself,\nceasing conscious thought.\n\nIn her final words to Treebeard during their parting at Isengard,\nGaladriel says she will “Not  in Middle-earth, nor until the\nlands that lie under the wave are lifted up again.  Then in the\nwillow-meads of Nan-tathren we may meet in the spring.  Farewell!” This\nsuggests that in the future, perhaps after the Dagor Dagorath, when the\nlands of Beleriand will be recovered again, Treebeard and, possibly all\nthe other Ents, will awaken again and that he will meet her again in\nNan-Tathren.",

    "text": "The MOUTH OF SAURON was a living man, the ambassador and messenger of\nSauron, the Lieutenant of the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr in Middle-earth\nand one of the most devoted and dark servants of Sauron at the time of\nthe War of the Ring. His true name had been forgotten, even by himself.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThe Mouth of Sauron's early history is unknown, as is his true name and\nhow he first met Sauron. He was a Black Númenórean who briefly appeared\nin person when he haggled with the Army of the West in front of the\nMorannon, trying to convince Aragorn and Gandalf to give up and let\nSauron win the battle for Middle-earth. Had the plans of Sauron\nsucceeded, the Mouth of Sauron would have become the new lord of\nIsengard, replacing Saruman. When Gandalf turned down his proposal, the\nMouth of Sauron set all the armies of Udûn upon them.\n\nThe Mouth of Sauron was the Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dûr, and\ncommanded the Orc armies of Gorgoroth. The Mouth of Sauron communicated\ndirectly with the Dark Lord. A man of great stature, potentially the\nequal of other Dúnedain, the Mouth of Sauron had fallen into darkness.\n\nThe Black Númenóreans had established their dwellings in Middle-earth\nduring the years of Sauron's domination and worshipped him. The Mouth of\nSauron entered the service of the Dark Tower when it first rose again\n(its rebuilding began in 2951 of the Third Age), and through cunning\ngrew to power under Sauron and learned great sorcery.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nThe Mouth of Sauron appeared briefly before the host of the West prior\nto the Battle of the Black Gate. He insulted the host, asking who had\nauthority to treat with him, and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King. But\nthen Aragorn's gaze frightened him, and he cried out that he was a\nherald and an ambassador, and must not be attacked. Gandalf assured him\nhe would not be, so the Mouth took Gandalf to be the spokesman. He then\nbrought forth Sam's sword, a grey cloak with an Elven-brooch, and\nFrodo's mithril-vest, and said that the fate of the “spy” who carried\nthem would depend on their actions, and insinuated that if they did not\ndo as Sauron demanded, the “spy” would be tortured for many years.\n\nGandalf asked what the terms were, and the Mouth said that the Hobbit\nwould be allowed to go free, so long as the captains follow Mordor's\nconditions: that the “rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies” withdraw\nbeyond the Anduin River, swearing oaths “never again to assail Sauron\nthe Great in arms, open or secret”; that all lands East of the Anduin\nRiver would belong to Sauron alone, forever; that all lands West up to\nthe Gap of Rohan would pay tribute to Mordor; that they could no longer\nkeep and bear arms, though Sauron would allow them to govern their own\naffairs so long as they helped to rebuild Isengard, which would be then\nruled by a master more reliable than Saruman (presumably the Mouth\nhimself). Gandalf replied that was too much for the ransom of one\nservant, and in any case he doubted that Sauron would keep his word.\nGandalf demanded that the prisoner be brought forth, but of course the\nMouth could not comply except to say, “These are the terms. Take them or\nleave them!” Gandalf responded, “These we will take!” and seized the\nMithril coat, the cloak, and the sword, and utterly rejected Sauron's\nterms, before telling the Mouth to be gone, as they had not come to\nbargain with Sauron, much less with one of his slaves. Enraged and\nfearful at the same time, the Mouth fled back to the Gate and set\nMordor's forces upon the West.\n\n\nAge\n\nThe Mouth served Sauron after Sauron came to Mordor. There is some\ndispute over the length of time this implies. If it refers to Sauron's\nmost recent return to Mordor, the Mouth of Sauron would have served\nSauron for some 68 years when he encountered Aragorn and Gandalf. But\nsome have stated that since Mordor “first rose again” during Sauron's\nreturn shortly after the destruction of Númenor, the Mouth of Sauron may\nbe well over thousands of years old. Since no mortal could live that\nlong, and Tolkien says explicitly that he was a living man and not a\nwraith, he is believed to be around the same age, or less, as Aragorn.\nThis is further suggested by drafts of _The Return of the King_, in\nwhich he is a renegade Man of Gondor.",

    "text": "FINGON, the Valiant was an Ñoldorin Elf, the eldest son of Fingolfin,\nand older brother of Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon.\n\nHe was High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth during the First Age\nafter the death of his father. He was an instrument in healing the rift\nbetween the Sons of Fëanor and the followers of his father after their\ndesertion of them in Araman.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFingon was born in Aman, probably in Tirion where the House of Finwë was\nlocated. When the Ñoldor were resolved to return to Middle-earth, Fingon\nfollowed his father and his people, though they were drawn more to the\nruling of their own realms and adventurism rather than vengeance and the\nrecovery of the Silmarils, as Fëanor and his sons sought. He fought in\nthe first Kinslaying but only because he, seeing Elf fighting Elf,\nbelieved that the Teleri had been told to prevent the Ñoldor from\nleaving Aman by force by the Valar.\n\nAfter Fëanor's abandonment of them, Fingon and his people were led by\nFingolfin and crossed the perilous icy wastes of Helcaraxë. They arrived\nin Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age and the Noldor\nwitnessed the arising of the Sun.\n\n\n\nAfter the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, Maedhros, Fingon's\ncousin and friend, was taken and hung by the wrist upon Thangorodrim.\nFingon marched to Thangorodrim and with the help of Thorondor, Lord of\nthe Eagles, found Maedhros. Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, but\nFingon instead severed Maedhros's hand by the wrist, and brought him\nback to the Noldorin camp. It was this act of bravery and compassion\nthat resolved the dispute as to whose house would rule over the Ñoldor\nin Middle-earth, for Maedhros renounced his claim to the High Kingship\nof the Ñoldor, instead ceding it to House of Fingolfin.\n\nFingolfin gave him a domain in Dor-lómin, in the west of Hithlum, where\nhe did good service during the Siege of Angband, defeating an Orc army\nthat attempted to go around to the north and attack Hithlum from the\nwest, and then later the first to fight against the dragon Glaurung when\nhe first came forth from Angband during the Dagor Aglareb.\n\nFingon became High King when Fingolfin died dueling with Morgoth after\nthe Dagor Bragollach. Seven years later, Morgoth's forces invaded\nHithlum, and Fingon was hard-pressed and outnumbered, but Círdan and the\npeople of the Falas, who came up the Firth of Drengist rescued them in\ntheir ships.\n\n\n\nFingon's final battle was the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon led the attack\non Angband, and the fury of his warriors nearly won the day.\nUnfortunately, due to Ulfang's treachery, Maedhros did not arrive until\nthree days after he was expected. This resulted in Morgoth releasing his\nBalrogs and Glaurung the dragon on the already weakened Ñoldor force.\nWhen Maedhros finally arrived, hope was reborn for Fingon's army;\nhowever, Ulfang's treachery again took effect, causing Maedhros to\nwithdraw. Fingon was then surrounded and his guards killed. He dueled\nGothmog, lord of Balrogs, but was struck from behind by another. Gothmog\nthen clove Fingon's helm, and fire sprang from it. This presumably\nkilled Fingon instantly, but the Balrogs proceeded to beat his body into\nthe dust long after he was dead. Thus the day ended in defeat for the\nelves.\n\nHis younger brother Turgon became the next rightful High King of the\nÑoldor, even though his host retreated after the battle and remained\nsecretly in Gondolin.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nHe was described as follows: “His valour was as a fire yet steadfast as\nthe hills of stone; wise he was and skilled in voice and hand; troth and\njustice he loved and bore goodwill to all, both Elves and Men, hating\nMorgoth only; he sought not his own, neither power nor glory, and death\nwas his reward.”\n\nThe only note of Fingon's physical appearance describes that Fingon\n“wore his long dark hair in great plaits braided with gold”.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Fingon_ is the Sindarin version of his Quenyan father-name\nFINDEKÁNO. The exact origin of the name Findekáno is unclear, but it\nmay possible be from the words _findë_ (“hair”) or _phin_ (“skill”), and\n_kane_ (“valour”) or _káno_ (“commander, lesser chief”).\n\nThe name Findekáno could mean either “cunning commander”, or rather\nunusually, “hair commander”. In Sindarin, _fin_ translates to\n“hair”.",

    "text": "MANWË (Quenya; IPA: - “Blessed One”) was the leader of the Ainur, one of\nthe Aratar, King of the Valar, husband of Varda, brother of the Dark\nLord Melkor, and King of Arda. He was also known as SÚLIMO, _'Mânawenûz\nOR Valahiru _'and lives atop Mount Taniquetil in Valinor, the highest\nmountain of the world. The winds and airs are his servants. He was the\ngreatest in authority, but not in power, of all the Valar, Melkor being\nmore powerful. He was however the greatest of the Aratar, among whom\nMelkor was not counted. Biography Manwë was (with Melkor) the eldest of\nthe Ainur, and the one that best understood the will of Eru. When Melkor\ncreated the discord in the Music of the Ainur, the Second Theme of Eru\nthat rose to counter the discord used Manwë as its chief instrument.\nWhen Arda was formed, Manwë was appointed Ruler of Arda, hence his most\ncommon title, the Elder King. Manwë was a kind, compassionate ruler,\nunconcerned with his own power. He oversaw all of the Valar's early\nattempts to order Arda, but was unable to stop Melkor's rampages until\nthe Vala Tulkas came to Arda to assist his brethren. Afterwards, the\nValar under Manwë made an abode on Middle-earth in the Isle of Almaren\nand constructed the two Lamps of the Valar to provide light to the\nworld. But Melkor destroyed the lamps, and the Valar retreated to the\ncontinent of Aman, which they heavily fortified. Eventually, the Elves\nawoke in Middle-earth, and Manwë at last went with the other Valar to\nsubdue Melkor. They succeeded, and Melkor was imprisoned in the Halls of\nMandos. He extended an invitation to the Elves to journey to Aman and\nlive there amongst the Valar. For the three Ages of Melkor's\nimprisonment, the Valar and the Elves lived in peace and happiness. But\neventually Melkor was allowed to plead for pardon before Manwë again. As\nManwë was completely free of evil, he was unable to comprehend it,\nleading him to believe Melkor's lies concerning his reformation. He\nreleased Melkor from Mandos, whereupon Melkor began plotting the\ndownfall of the Elves and the ruin of Aman's bliss. He began to cleverly\nspread lies amongst the Ñoldor, who soon grew to resent the Valar\nbecause of said lies. Eventually, due to the rebellious actions of the\nNoldor prince Fëanor, Melkor's lies were uncovered, but he escaped\nbefore he could be recaptured. Soon thereafter, Melkor recruited the\ngreat spider Ungoliant and poisoned the Two Trees. He then murdered the\nKing of the Noldor, Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and incited Fëanor's\nleaving Aman with most of the Noldor in rebellion. Soon thereafter,\nManwë learned that the rebellious Noldor had attacked and slaughtered\nmany of the Teleri. As such, he forbade the Ñoldor from returning to\nValinor once they left, and stated also that the Elves would receive no\nhelp from the Valar in their war against Morgoth. He then caused Valinor\nto be hidden by way of the Shadowy Seas and the Enchanted Isles to\nprevent the Ñoldor from returning. To hearten the Eldar, he had Aulë\nfashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the Atani was\ncoming soon, and sent Thorondor and the Eagles to watch them. After\nMorgoth's fall, Manwë cast him into the void. Manwë dresses in blue\nrobes and has blue eyes. He wields a scepter of sapphire made for him by\nthe Ñoldor. The Vanyar are his favorite Elves, and they live with him\nand Varda on Mount Taniquetil. Maiar of Manwë - Eönwë, Manwë's\nbanner-bearer and herald. In earlier conceptions of the legendarium,\nEönwë, then called FIONWË ÚRION, was envisioned as the son of Manwë and\nbrother of Erinti, renamed as Ilmarë, Varda's handmaiden. - In some\nversions, FIONWË, later named Eönwë, is the one who will kill Morgoth\nfor his love for Urwendi (Later named Arien). - Olórin (Gandalf), the\nsecond-in-command (and later leader) of the wizards sent to Middle-earth\nto fight against Sauron, and Manwë comforted him when Olórin showed\nuneasiness and fear of Sauron's powers. Etymology The name _MANWË_ means\n“blessed one” or “blessed person”, from the Quenya _man_ (“blessed”) and\n_wë_ (“person”). SÚLIMO literally means “the Breather”, from the Quenya\n_súlimë_ (“wind”) and Sindarin _sûl_ (“wind”). His Sindarin name is ARAN\nEINIOR, the “Elder King”.

    "lotr_page_id": "497",
    "text": "SHELOB was a Great Spider, that was the greatest offspring of Ungoliant,\nthe primordial spider. During the Third Age she lived in Mordor and was\nknown to feed indiscriminately, preying on the inhabitants. She was\nencountered by Frodo and Sam in their quest to destroy the One Ring.\nShelob's early history is completely unknown, save for the assumption\nthat she was born in the Ered Gorgoroth and that she was the “last\nchild” of Ungoliant. By the Second Age, she often feasted on her own\nchildren, and that at some point after fleeing from Beleriand, yet long\nbefore Sauron took the land of Mordor for himself she spun a dark lair\nin the Ephel Duath (Mountains of Shadow), near Cirith Ungol in the\npasses above Minas Morgul. For hundreds of years, she resided there\nmaking a labyrinth of webs within a network of caves to better trap her\nprey, which included all creatures great and small. She feasted\nprimarily on those who wandered into her webs, though if a particularly\njuicy morsel was available, she would silently pursue and kill it.\n\nSauron was aware of Shelob's presence in the mountains and allowed her\nto dwell there, for she made an excellent, if incidental, guard for the\npassage of Cirith Ungol. Sauron was known to be somewhat fond of her,\nand in a rare show of humor, was even known to refer to her as his cat.\nSauron would sometimes give her food in the form of prisoners that he\nhad no more use for or servants who had displeased him. Reports of the\nmassacre made by Shelob would be carried back to Barad-dur to further\nplease the Dark Lord's humor. She would also sometimes eat Orcs that\nmanned the tower of Cirith Ungol. However, as she was a more effective\nguard for the pass than they, Sauron never made any serious attempt to\nstop her (though Orcs would occasionally try to barricade her lair with\nstones).\n\nAt one point after being set free from Mordor, Gollum stumbled into her\nlair while attempting to escape the barren country. She caught him, but\nhe survived the encounter by promising to bring her tastier meats than\nhe. Orcs of Cirith Ungol had seen him on several occasions and\nbelieved that he was too thin and wiry for Shelob to bother eating.\n\nGollum would attempt later to fulfill this promise by leading Frodo and\nSam into her lair and abandoning them. His hope was that once Shelob\nfinished consuming the two hobbits, she would throw away the Ring with\nthe other parts of the hobbits that she could not eat, allowing Gollum\nto retrieve it. The two hobbits eventually happened upon a passageway\nthat was too choked with Shelob's dark cobwebs to proceed, but as\nfortune would have it, Frodo's sword Sting, being of Elvish make, was\nable to slice through them. Using the Phial of Galadriel, they managed\nto fend her off the first time. Earendil's Star the Light from the\nPhial, caused unbearable stabbing pain to Shelob's darkened senses, but\nshe returned to attack Frodo poisoning him with her stinger in a\nsurprise attack just as they had reached the exit of the cave on the\nMordor side.\n\nSam then assaulted the creature using Sting in order to save his master,\nwho lay poisoned after Shelob's surprise attack. In a pitched battle,\nSam managed to stab one of her great eyes, injuring her leg, and pierce\nher great belly, the most grievous wound. Sam was lucky indeed as Shelob\ncaused this wound herself, when she tried to stab him with the venomous\nstinger in the underside of her abdomen. None had ever wounded her so\nbadly before.\n\nIt is not known if Shelob recovered from the battle, or if she succumbed\nto her wounds, as the book specifies that her fate will remain unknown\nto the people of Middle-earth. The last time she is mentioned is when\nSam wears the one ring, and hears Shelob “bubbling” in her misery far\naway, as his sense of hearing is vastly improved by wearing the Ring.\n\nWhile Shelob's ultimate fate was unknown, her offspring (which were\nlucky enough to escape her hunger) continued to produce new generations\nof spiders.

She usually immobilized her prey with her paralyzing sting\nthat enabled her to feed on her victims at her leisure, but could also\ncrush her prey to death by swiftly dropping on them. Her head was\nCris-crossed with scars and she had a number of missing eyes.

    "text": "GLAURUNG was the first terrestrial, fire-breathing Dragon in\nMiddle-earth. He is known as the Father of Dragons.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Years\n\nAfter suffering a number of defeats at the hands of the Ñoldor in\nBeleriand, Morgoth came to realize that his armies of Orcs were no match\nfor the Noldor unaided. As such, he began to experiment with ways to\ncreate new, deadlier creatures for use in his armies. Glaurung was the\nresult of these experiments. After a century of brooding and growing in\nthe dark pits of Angband, Glaurung first emerged in FA 260 and attacked\nthe Elves maintaining the Siege of Angband. Though Glaurung was not of\nthe winged race that would later arise, he was the greatest terror of\nhis time. He burned and ravaged Ard-galen, the land of the Elves in\nHithlum and Dorthonion. However, he was not yet at his full strength, so\nwas driven back by Fingon, the prince of Hithlum at that time, and his\narchers. Morgoth was displeased with Glaurung for revealing himself\nbefore he had grown to full strength, as Morgoth had planned for\nGlaurung's existence to be a complete surprise.\n\nTo Glaurung, this attack was merely a youthful testing of his strength.\nTerrible as he was to the Elves, the armor of his scales was still\nvulnerable to the bite of weapons. However, despite his untimely foray,\nMorgoth's plans were not disrupted.\n\nWar upon the Elves\n\nDagor Bragollach\n\nGlaurung was contained in Angband for another two centuries before he\nwas again loosed during the Fourth Battle of the Battles of Beleriand.\nKnown as the Dagor Bragollach for the fires unleashed by Morgoth from\nthe Iron Mountains, Glaurung in full power led Melkor's forces against\nthe High Elves of Beleriand. Now fully grown, none could withstand his\nmight, and with the Balrogs at his side, Glaurung led the Orcs to an\noverwhelming victory and broke the siege of Angband.\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad\n\nIn the fifth battle, the\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung caused even more destruction, as he had\nfathered a brood of lesser Dragons to follow him into battle. So a great\narmy of Elves and Men fell before the onslaught, for none could\nwithstand the Dragonfire save the Dwarves of Belegost, who had come to\nbattle a common foe.\n\nAfter the Elven and Edain armies had been broken, Morgoth used Glaurung\nto hold the territories he gained; but force in battle was not the only\npower the monster knew. He brought many under his sway with the binding\npower of his serpent eye and hypnotic Dragon Spell.\n\nThe Sack of Nargothrond\n\nAfter Glaurung aided Morgoth during the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, he\nwas given the assignment to complete the Sack of Nargothrond, one of the\nElven fortresses in Beleriand. Glaurung came upon Nargothrond with great\nforce, and sacked the kingdom easily. He faced Túrin, son of Húrin, at\nthe gate and so he froze Túrin with his eyes. Túrin heard the screams of\nFinduilas, daughter of Orodreth, as he stood there. When the captives\nhad been taken away, Glaurung unfroze Túrin and gave him two choices:\nthe first to follow Finduilas, and the second to aid his mother and\nsister, who were suffering in Dor-lómin. Túrin chose the latter, and in\nthis way he was deceived by the dragon, for his mother and sister were\nliving well in Doriath. Glaurung then gathered up all the treasures of\nFelagund and hoarded them deep within Nargothrond's underground halls,\nhe then sat atop his hoard, guarding it jealously, and so he rested.\n\nLast Years\n\nGlaurung received knowledge of Morwen and Nienor's departure to seek\ntheir family members. In the forest where they were travelling, Glaurung\nfound Nienor and caused her to lose her mind. This caused her to run\nthrough the forest “like a deer”. Soon after this, Túrin found her\ncrying on Finduilas's grave. Not knowing that she was his sister, Túrin\nnamed her Níniel (Tear maiden) and took her to his home with the folk of\nBrandir. There they lived for the next three years, during which they\nfell in love.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter those years, Glaurung attacked the area around their home. Túrin\nresolved to kill the dragon. Two men went with him. One became afraid\nand fled, and the other was crushed by rocks. However, Túrin was able to\nkill Glaurung by thrusting his sword, Gurthang, into Glaurung's belly.\nGlaurung felt his death wound and screamed. When the dragon's blood\ntouched Túrin, he fell into a swoon. Glaurung screamed until his\nstrength was gone. Nienor found him there, with Túrin beside him. With\nhis last breath, Glaurung gave Nienor her memory back, and died. Shortly\nthereafter, Nienor jumped into the river below, and Túrin awoke and\nthrew himself on his sword.\n\nEarliest version\n\nIn _The Book of Lost Tales II_, _Glorund_ was the early name of\nGlaurung.",

    "text": "DÁIN II IRONFOOT (or simply KING DÁIN) was the son of Náin and the\ngrandson of Grór, the youngest son of Dáin I of Durin's folk, and was\nlord of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills in Wilderland. He was a Dwarven\nKing of Durin's Folk, the fifth King under the Mountain, and the Lord of\nthe Iron Hills during the War of the Ring in Middle-earth in the late\nThird Age. \n\n\nBiography\n\nWar of the Dwarves and Orcs\n\nDáin followed his grandfather, Grór, in lordship after Nain was killed\nby the great Orc chieftain Azog during the Battle of Azanulbizar, the\nfinal conflict in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, before he could\ninherit the lordship. Almost immediately after the death of Náin, Dáin\nrushed up the steps and slew Azog himself, thus avenging his father's\ndeath. He was a very young Dwarf at the time, being only thirty-two\nyears of age, by the Dwarves reckoning, he was still a stripling. Dáin's\nfeat was heralded as a magnificent and glorious triumph for one so\nyoung. Dáin alone looked past the gate into Moria, and had the wisdom to\nknow that it was impossible for the dwarves to return at that time. His\nkingdom at the Iron Hills was so great that they were the only people\ntruly capable of dealing with Sauron's forces at that time.\n===Battle of the Five Armies===\n\n\n\nDáin was the friend and cousin of Thorin Oakenshield, and responded to\nThorin's call for help during the quest to reclaim the Lonely\nMountain. Dáin marched with five hundred Dwarven soldiers,\nexceptionally strong even by Dwarven standards, clad in heavy chainmail\nand iron boots, and armed with mattocks, shields, and swords. He arrived\njust in time for the Battle of the Five Armies. After the battle,\nDain thanked the Eagles for their timely intervention, crowning their\nchief with gold and swearing the dwarves to everlasting friendship with\nthem. He also honored Thorin's committments to Bard the Bowman and Bilbo\nBaggins, giving a fourteenth share of the Mountain's treasure to the\npeople of Lake-town, and promising an even greater share to Bilbo, who\npolitely declined to take more than two small chests, filled with silver\nand gold. Dain also granted the emeralds of Girion to King Thranduil,\nwho prized them greatly.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n\n\nAfter Thorin's death, Dáin became King under the Mountain and King of\nDurin's folk, the first not to be in a direct line. Dáin was a wise and\njust leader, and brought much wealth to the mountain realm and was on\ngood terms with the Men of Dale in the south and the Elven king of\nNorthern Mirkwood as well, which ensured peace for many years to come.\nWhen Balin and other dwarves decided to reclaim Moria, Dáin initially\nrefused, but Balin insisted on going.\nA few months before the Council of Elrond, a messenger from Mordor\nappeared at the entrance of the Lonely Mountain and offered the Dwarves\nan alliance with Sauron, asking only in return that the Dwarves share\nwhat they knew “concerning Hobbits”, and help to track down the One\nRing, which the messenger described as “least of rings... a trifle that\nSauron fancies.”  The messenger said that, if the Dwarves could deliver\nthe Ring itself, then Sauron would return three of the Rings of Power\nthat originally belonged to the Dwarf-Lords, and Moria would be theirs\nto possess forever.  On the other hand, the messenger warned that\n“things will not seem so well” if the Dwarves did not help.\n\nSuspicious and apparently recognizing old enemies such as Orcs, Dain\nrefused to be bribed or blackmailed, and sent the messenger away without\nan answer, and instead sent Glóin to Rivendell, to consult with Elrond,\nwhile Dáin prepared the Lonely Mountain for war.\n\nDeath\n\nDáin participated in the\nWar of the Ring's northern campaign but was killed during the Battle of\nDale in TA 3019, defending the body of King Brand of Dale before the\ngates of the Lonely Mountain. He was, by then, an extremely old Dwarf,\nat the age of two-hundred and fifty-two, but still strong for his age.\nHe was still among the greatest of the Dwarven warriors, a direct\ndescendant of Durin and his prowess in battle was nearly unmatched.\n\nAfter news of his death reached Minas Tirith, Gandalf remarked that, as\nsaddened as they must be at Dáin's death, they should be glad that he\ndied in battle, defending his friend's body, as well as amazed that he\nwas still as formidable a warrior as he had been when he was a young\ndwarf: \n\n    _“I should call that a heavy loss, if it was not a wonder rather\n    that in his great age he could still wield his axe as mightily as\n    they say he did, standing over the body of King Brand before the\n    gate of Erebor, until the darkness fell.”_\n\nAfter his death during the war, his son, Thorin III Stonehelm, succeeded\nhim.",

    "text": "IRMO (Quenya; IPA: - “Desirer” or “Master of Desires”) is an Ainu, and a\nVala who was responsible for the creation of dreams and desires as well\nas visions too. He was more commonly known as Lórien, after the name of\nhis dwelling place. Irmo-Lórien was the younger brother of Námo who also\nlike his brother was commonly known as Mandos the name of his dwelling\nplace, and also the brother of Nienna (_Lady of Pity and Mourning_).\n\n\nBiography\n\nLÓRIEN, along with his brother Námo-Mandos, were known as the\n_Fëanturi_, the “Masters of Spirits”. Between them, Lórien was the\n“Master of Visions, Dreams, and Desires”. His wife Estë _the Gentle_\nlived with him in Lórien where the Gardens of Lórien were considered as\nthe fairest and most beautiful place in the world and was filled with\nmany spirits. Melian dwelt in Lórien for a time, tending to the trees\nthat flowered there before she departed to Middle-earth. All the Valar\nof Aman, would indeed come often to the gardens of Lórien to rest from\nthe cares of Arda, and they would also draw refreshment from the\nfountains of Lórien and Estë. Along with that, there were many Maiar who\nserved Lórien and Estë in Lórien. \n\nThough Lórien dwelt far away from Valmar, his dwelling was still within\nthe Realm of Valinor. Together, Lórien and Estë provided a refuge in\nValinor in the groves and gardens of Lórien. In his fair gardens, Lórien\ntended to the Elves of Valinor and would provide the them with guiding\nvisions and dreams.\n\nDuring the Noontide of Valinor when the Elves lived in Valinor, Míriel\nof the Ñoldor grew weary and tired of her earthly life after giving\nbirth to her infamous son Fëanor and she yearned release from the labor\nof living. Hence, Manwë commanded Lórien to take her under his care.\nThen Míriel went to Lórien's gardens to lay down and rest but her spirit\nquickly departed silently from her body to the halls of Mandos and\nthereafter never came back. Nevertheless, the maids of his wife Estë\ntended to the body of Míreal so that it would not whither\n\nWhen the Sun and Moon were originally set in their paths, Varda purposed\nthat the two vessels should journey in Ilmen and ever be aloft. It was\nlargely due to the prayers of Lórien and his wife who declared that\nsleep and rest had been banished from the Earth; therefore, Varda\nchanged her council and allowed for a time of night where the world\nwould still have shadow and half-light.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name IRMO was a Quenya word that meant _Desirer_ or _Master of\nDesires_. He was also given the title _Master of Dreams._\n\n\nCharacter\n\nLórien did not work in the open, his power was unseen and his influence\nwas subtle even to the Wise. He was not sought in scenes of strife or\nwoe where conflict took place. He sent hope to the Children of Ilúvatar\nwhen the darkness of Morgoth covered Middle-earth. Lórien was sought in\ninspiration, in desire, in hope, and in the dreams and hearts of those\nthat opposed evil. He was associated with hope, inspiration, love,\ndesire, dreams, sleep, and visions.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nLórien's dwellings were built south at the feet of the great mountains\nof Aman. Soon after, Aulë (_Master of Craftsmanship_) had created\nLórien's halls of mist gathering beyond Avathar from the misty shadowy\nseas. The halls of Lórien were great and dimly lit, and the wide gardens\nof Lórien wandered marvelously about winding near to the feet of the\ngreat silver Tree Telperion whose shining silver light lit the gardens\nof Lórien.\n\nYavanna (_Queen of the Earth_) gave Lórien a great wealth of yew trees\nand cedars, and pines that exuded drowsy aromas at dusk, and these trees\nwere hung over by deep pools of water. In the midst of his gardens,\nLórien set a ring of shadowy yew trees reaching high above his cauldron\n_Silindrin_ where he would gaze upon it and see many visions.\n\n Manwë was grieved when\nthe Valar had to hide Valinor from the rest of the world. Because of\nthis, and that of the coming of Men was nearly coming, Manwë ordered\nLórien to create a path where the spirits of Elves and Men can come to\nthe Gardens of Lorien. So Lórien went about creating the “Path of\nDreams”, known to the Elves as the _Olórë Mallë_. The _Path_ was a\nspiritual road to Valinor, only accessible through the mind. It was\nthrough this path that the Elves and the Men loyal to the Valar\ntravelled in their sleep. The final destination was the _Gardens of\nLórien_. Lórien blocked the _Olórë Mallë_ from the Ñoldor when they\nrebelled against the Valar and left Valinor and Manwë decreed that they\ncould never return to Valinor.\n\nAt the time of the Hiding of Valinor, the _Island of Tol Eressëa_ was\nwoven with magical spells. Henceforth, of those the mariners who had\nbeen able to step foot upon the _Isle of Tol Eressëa_, were never seen\nagain in life. Soon, they became overwhelmed with age-long sleep by the\npower of Lórien upon that Isle.",

    "text": "AR-PHARAZÔN, also known as AR-PHARAZÔN THE GOLDEN, was the twenty-fifth\nand last King of Númenor. Of all the Kings of Númenor, he wielded the\nmost power, but used it most unwisely; his desire for more eternal life\ncaused the destruction of Númenor and the Change of the World.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAr-Pharazôn was the son of Gimilkhâd, the leader of the King's Men\nduring the reign of Tar-Palantir of Númenor. Ar-Pharazôn grew into a Man\nof great strength, stature, and will, not unlike the ancient heroes of\nthe Edain. In these earlier days, he was good friends with Amandil, the\nfuture Lord of Andúnië and his line of people. However, he was his\nfather's child and thus was instructed to follow in the ways of the\nKing's Men.\n\nAr-Pharazôn became a man of great pride and was eager for more wealth\nand glory. He grew restless in his homeland and was often abroad leading\nlike-minded Numenoreans in the wars that they were waging against the\nmen of Middle-earth. In this he fared well on both land and sea for he\nwon great wealth, and gained great respect as a captain. When he finally\nreturned home, the people rejoiced in him and he was very popular and\ngenerous with the wealth and fortunes he won in Middle-earth.\n\nUpon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn\ndecided to wed his daughter, Míriel, which was against her will. As\nTar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn was\nable to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel,\nrefusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges\nof the Faithful.\n\nAs time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of\nMordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being\ncalled the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to\nchallenge him lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor\nwith an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But\nSauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's\nmight. However, Ar-Pharazôn did not trust Sauron, and brought him back\nto Númenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his\nsituation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery,\nlies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted\nadvisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharazôn, convincing him to worship\nMorgoth in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality. Some of\nthe results of Sauron's cunning were the erecting of a Great Temple to\nMorgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of\nthe White Tree of Númenor. Soon the king and his followers were\nworshiping Morgoth openly and burning innocents at the altar of the\ntemple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god.\n\nThen, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able\nto convince him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by\nforce. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to\nattack Valinor in SA 3310 and finally broke the Ban of the Valar,\nlanding on the shores of the Undying Lands in SA 3319. The Valar then\nlaid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One.\nHe sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Númenor beneath the ocean,\nchanging the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to\nMiddle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only\nelves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it following the\nStraight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who\nlanded on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt and remain in the Caves of\nthe Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath. He and his great\narmy's role in the end of days has not been made clear.\n\n\nLegacy and successors\n\nAr-Pharazôn's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of\nthe Valar and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal\nNúmenórean line. Instead, the line of Elros was continued from the long\nline of the Lords of Andúnië. As Amandil of Andúnië did not return from\nhis venture into the west, his son Elendil became the successor of a new\nkingdom that would rule from Middle-earth in exile. His two surviving\nsons, Isildur and Anárion followed him into exile and would in turn\nbecome his successors as well.\n\nAr-Pharazôn was remembered by the surviving Númenorean lineage with a\nsort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last\nHuman capable to beat and humiliate the powerful dark lord Sauron by\nhimself. In remembrance to this feat, in Umbar was erected a monument to\nthe Golden King of Númenor: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white\ncolumn, which absorbed sunrays and glimmered in the night for everyone\nto see. The monument was destroyed when Umbar corsairs swore allegiance\nto Sauron.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis chosen royal name of _Pharazôn_ which means “GOLDEN” was in Adûnaic;\nhis name in Quenya was _Tar-Calion_ with _Calion_ meaning “SON OF\nLIGHT”.",

    "text": "YAVANNA (Quenya; IPA: - “Giver of Fruits”) was of the Ainur and Valar,\nand one of the Aratar who was responsible for the growth of all the\nfruits and growing things of Arda. She was also called KEMENTÁRI\n(Quenya; IPA: “Queen of the Earth”), IVON (Sindarin; IPA: “Giver of\nFruits”). She resided in the Pastures of Yavanna, in the south of\nValinor.\n\nShe is the wife of Aulë, older sister of Vána , and kin to Melian.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBeginning in the Years of the Lamps during the Spring of Arda, she\nplanted and caused to grow the first growing things of the world (trees\nand plants), which she had long prepared. At first, just as every other\nthing in the world that the Valar nurtured and cared for, these things\nprospered and thrived for a time. Melkor, however, had his own plans and\nthey involved taking the world from his brethren and ruling it for\nhimself. From his great fortress of Utumno in the far north, he sent\nforth his poisons into the veins of the world blighting the Spring of\nArda. Then the things of Yavanna fell sick and rotted and soon after\nMelkor assaulted and destroyed the Two Lamps, breaking the world.\n\nAfterwards, the Valar relocated to the continent of Aman where they\ncreated the Two Trees - the only light in the whole world at that time.\nMiddle-earth was left in darkness, and the living things that survived\nwere put into a great sleep by Yavanna until the rise of the Sun and the\nMoon many thousands of years later.\n\nAfter Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna\nfeared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Eru\nanswered her plea by creating Ents to protect the trees.\n\nIn the Song of the Ainur, Yavanna sang of branches of great trees that\nwould receive the rain of Manwë and Ulmo, and some trees sang\nto Ilúvatar. This is said to be the conception of the Shepherds of the\nTrees. Her thought also met with Manwe's, setting the arrival of\nthe Great Eagles.\n\nIn the beginning of days, Yavanna planted the first seeds of Arda and\nwatched over the Olvar and all growing things. As Morgoth was corrupting\nher beloved creatures, she contended with him and supported all the\nplans against him. After his expulsion from Arda she planted the seeds\nthat she had long devised and life came to Middle-earth during\nthe Spring of Arda, although in the beginning no flowers bloomed. When\nthe Two Lamps were destroyed much of the life on Middle-earth slumbered\nin the Sleep of Yavanna that lasted until the rising of the Moon and\nthe Sun.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Lamps the Valar withdrew to Aman and\ncreated Valinor. Upon the green mound of Ezellohar, Yavanna sat and sang\nwhile the other Valar sat and listened. Her song, with the aid of the\ntears of Nienna brought forth the Two Trees, her greatest creation,\nwhich gave light to the land. However, Yavanna did not forsake the Outer\nLands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Morgoth and\nurged the other Valar to wage war on him before the Awakening of the\nElves.\n\nAfter Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna\nfeared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Aulë, in\nreply, told her that even Elves and Men, the true Children of\nIlúvatar would have need of her trees as well. Yavanna lamented\nto Manwë, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from\nthe dominion of others. Manwë brought her concerns before Ilúvatar in\nprayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea\nby creating the Ents to protect the trees.\n\nWhen the Elves built Tirion upon Tol Eressëa Yavanna fashioned the\ntree Galathilion, a lesser image of Telperion, for the court beneath\nthe Mindon.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains\nand told the other Valar that if she could use the light of\nthe Silmarils she could heal them. This light she was denied by the will\nof Fëanor. Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring\nforth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit\nfrom Laurelin. She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels\nfor them and thus created the Moon and the Sun.\n\nFor the Men who had stood with the Valar in the War of Wrath the land\nof Andor was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by\nYavanna. When the Edain came to this island they created the realm\nof Númenor. In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to\nsend emissaries to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Maia Curumo to\ntake her servant, Aiwendil, with him.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Quenya, _Yavanna_ means “Giver of Fruits”, from _yáve_ (“fruit”)\nand _anna_ (“gift”). KEMENTÁRI, her epithet, means “Queen of the\nEarth”, from _kemen_ (“the Earth”) and _tari_ (“Queen”).\n\nHer name in Sindarin is IVON, the “Giver of Fruits”. It is only attested\nin the compound _Ivonwin_(“Maidens of Yavanna”). The month\n_Ivanneth_ may have been named after Yavanna.\n\nEarlier names\n\n_PALÚRIEN_ was an earlier name for Yavanna. It means “Lady of the Wide\nEarth.”",

    "text": "FINROD, also known fully as FINROD FELAGUND, was a Ñoldorin Elf who was\nborn in Aman, probably in Tirion. He was the eldest son of Finarfin and\nEärwen, and the brother of Galadriel, Angrod and Aegnor. Finrod was\none of the noblest elves of the House of Finarfin and a friend of Men.\nHis nobility and death saving Beren and his opposition to the Oath of\nFëanor allowed for his return to life in Valinor, making him the first\nElf to be reincarnated in the Undying Lands before the end of First Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFinrod was friendly with Turgon and the House of Fingolfin. He opposed\nFëanor and the Oath when he sought to return to Middle-earth to recover\nthe Silmarils from Morgoth, but chose not to be parted with his friends\nand so he followed his father and his House and the House of Fingolfin.\nFinrod did not fight in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë nor was he aware of\nit as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the\ncoast, the host encountered a figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of\nthe North. Afterwards, Finarfin and many of his followers departed and\nreturned to Tirion, but Finrod chose to continue onto Middle-earth with\nthe host of Fingolfin.\n\nFinrod founded the original Minas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion. In\naround FA 50, he and his friend Turgon, while journeying down the river\nSirion, encamped along its banks and were laid to rest by Ulmo. While\nasleep, Ulmo revealed to them the hidden realm of Nargothrond and the\nvalley of Tumladen. Finrod discovered the system of caves beneath the\nTaur-en-Faroth, protected by the Nagrod and the power of Ulmo, and here\nwent on to found his own kingdom and become Lord of Nargothrond.\n\nWhile hunting in the lands of Thargelion in East Beleriand, Finrod was\nfirst of the Ñoldor to come across Men. He stayed with them long,\nlearning their language and teaching them Sindarin. He also intervened\non behalf of the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, who feared Men would destroy\ntheir home, and he received the permission of King Thingol, who held\nrule over all Beleriand, to guide the Men to Estolad.\n\nFinrod had a close friendship with Andreth of the House of Bëor, whom he\noften visited during the Siege of Angband to converse with her on the\nmatters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and\nlater known as _Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth_.\n\n\n\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir of the House of Bëor saved Finrod's\nlife, and in friendship Finrod gave him his ring. This ring was later\nknown as the Ring of Barahir and was eventually handed down to Aragorn\nwhen told of his true identity. Years after the Dagor\nBragollach, Barahir's son Beren came to Nargothrond seeking help, and\nFinrod went with him on the Quest of the Silmaril to repay his debt,\nlaying down his kingship. Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in\nNargothrond at the time, persuaded (using fear of Morgoth, and barely\nveiled threats related to their Oath) most of Nargothrond to stay\nbehind; only ten warriors, headed by one, Edrahil, were faithful and\naccompanied their King.\n\nThough disguised by the arts of Finrod, the twelve were captured by\nSauron and taken to Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Minas Tirith, the castle\nFelagund himself had built. Finrod and Sauron battled with songs of\npower but despite a great display of skill and power by the Elven\nprince, Sauron eventually caught him in a devious trap and prevailed.\nBut Sauron could not discern who exactly they were, even though they\nwere revealed to him. Sauron imprisoned them, seeking to learn their\nerrand and identities, sending a werewolf to devour them one by one\nuntil they revealed their secret, yet none did. Sauron however perceived\nthat Finrod was a High Elven Lord of great power, and purposed to save\nhim for last. Eventually, when the wolf came for Beren, Finrod burst his\nchains and killed the wolf barehanded but was mortally wounded\nhimself.\n\nFinrod loved Amarië, a Vanyarin Elf, who didn't follow him to\nMiddle-earth. For this, though she and Finrod were betrothed, Finrod\nnever married while in Middle-earth. It is noted in the _Lay of\nLeithian_ that Finrod was soon allowed to return to life in Valinor and\n“now dwells with Amarië” and was described as walking “with Finarfin his\nfather beneath the trees in Eldamar”. Even though Mandos foretold\nthat any of the exiles who died would never be allowed to leave his\nhalls, Finrod alone was allowed to reembody in Valinor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Finrod_ is a Sindarin form of his Telerin (Quenya) name\nFINDARÁTO, with the approximate meaning “Mighty descendant of Finwë”.\nHis mother name is INGOLDO (“the Ñoldo”).\n\nFELAGUND is an Epessë given to him by the Dwarves that expanded the\ncaves of Nargothrond. It is actually of Dwarvish origin (or Sindarized\nKhuzdul) from the word _felak-gundu_ (“Hewer of Caves”).\n\nFinrod was also called by Bëor and his people NÓM (“Wisdom”), NÓMIN\n(“the Wise”), and “Friend-of-Men” which in elvish were\n_Edennil_ and _Atandil_, Sindarin and Quenya respectively.",

    "lotr_page_id": "2346",
    "text": "LÚTHIEN, also known as_' Tinúviel_', was an Elf Maiden of Doriath, the\nwife of Beren Erchamion, and the most beautiful of all the Children of\nIlúvatar to ever live. Her love of the mortal Edain Beren, for which she\nwas prepared to risk everything, including her life, was legendary and\nlamented forever in song and story. She and Beren braved Morgoth's\nhorrors, eventually winning the Silmaril and the respect of Thingol.\nThough their actions later resulted in both their deaths, their deeds\nwon them the pity of Mandos and a second life in Middle-earth.  Her\nromance with Beren was one of the great stories of the Elder Days that\nwere told for many ages after she lived.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\n And thus in anguish Beren paid for that great doom upon him laid, the\ndeathless love of Lúthien, too fair for love of mortal Men; and in his\ndoom was Lúthien snared, the deathless in his dying shared; and Fate\nthem forged a binding chain of living love and mortal pain. — The Lays\nof Beleriand, “The Doom of Lúthien”\n\nLúthien was the daughter of Elu Thingol, King of Doriath, and his Queen,\nMelian the Maia. Throughout the years before she met Beren, she lived\nas all the Elves of Doriath did: in a state of perfect blissful peace.\nShe was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair,\nsparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely\nvoice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - ''“the song of\nLuthien released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and\nflowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed”. ''She\nalso often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her\ngood friend Daeron's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously,\nbut she did not return it.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\n Lúthien was remembered in\nthe _Lay of Leithian_ as the first Elven woman to have fallen in love\nand married a mortal man, Beren, a Man of the House of Bëor whom she met\nin the woods of Doriath. Their relationship was unlikely from the\nbeginning: Lúthien was not only the cherished single daughter of the\nmost powerful Elven King in Beleriand, but also the daughter of a Maia,\na powerful angelic being of the race of the Ainur. Beren was a mortal\nman on the run from the first Dark Lord Morgoth.\n\n\n\nThingol was desperate not to let Beren marry his daughter, and set an\nimpossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring to Thingol one of\nthe Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown. Against monstrous odds, being\nkidnapped by the Sons of Fëanor and the death of Finrod Felagund, as\nwell as a confrontation with Sauron, the couple achieved the task with\nhelp from Huan, the Hound of Valinor, but Beren died as soon as it was\ncompleted. In grief, Lúthien lay down and died, passing to the Halls of\nMandos. There, in her grief, she sang to Mandos. Her song was of such\nbeauty that Mandos, for the first and only time in his existence, was\nmoved to pity. But Mandos had no authority to allow Beren to live again,\nso he went before Manwë for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel\nof Eru Ilúvatar himself. Two choices were then placed before Lúthien;\nshe could either dwell in Valimar with the Valar in bliss forever as\nreward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to\nlife again with Beren, on the condition that they would both be mortal\nand die the death of Men. For her love of Beren, Luthien chose the\nlatter.\n\nLater years\n\n\n\nAfter this, she became a mortal and returned to Middle-earth with Beren,\nand lived briefly in Tol Galen. They had a son, Dior, who was called\nElúchil, the Heir of Thingol.\n\nAfter the sack of Menegroth, Beren returned there and ambushed the\ndwarves and took Nauglamir back to Luthien. Her beauty combined with the\nsplendor of the gem and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the\nfairest land ever to have existed east of Valinor. On her death the\nNauglamír was delivered to her son Dior, which led to the ruin of\nDoriath.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe union of Beren and Lúthien was the first between a mortal Man and an\nElven maid. Their lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of the\nKingdom of Númenor, and then on to the Dúnedain, men living in exile in\nMiddle-earth, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond.\nLúthien's romance with Beren is one of the great stories of the Elder\nDays, and is mirrored by the later romance between Aragorn and Arwen\nEvenstar. According to legend, her line will never be broken as long as\nthe world lasts.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LÚTHIEN_ means “Daughter of Flowers”, from the Sindarin _luth_\n(“flower”). In Doriathrin, Luthien and Noldorin _Lhūthien_ means\n“enchantress”, which is derived from _luktiēnē_ (“enchantress”).\n_Lúthien_ may have been derived from the Old English word _Lufien,_\nwhich means “love”.\n\nTINÚVIEL means “Nightingale”, from the Quendian ''tindōmiselde ''. In\nSindarin, it means “Daughter of Twilight”, from _tinnu_ (“dusk,\ntwilight”) and the feminine suffix _-ien_ (“daughter”).",

    "lotr_page_id": "302",
    "text": "ÉOMER was a Man of Rohan and the eventual eighteenth King of Rohan, and\nfirst of the Third Line of their kings.\n\n\nBiography\n\nÉomer, born in TA 2991, of the House of Eorl, was the son of Éomund, a\ndescendant of Éofor, and of Theodwyn, sister of Theoden King. In TA\n3002, when Éomer was eleven, Éomund was slain in battle with Orcs.\nTheodwyn died of grief shortly afterward. Éomund also had a daughter\nnamed Éowyn, Éomer's sister. After they were orphaned Théoden adopted\nthem as his own children.\n\nÉomer became the third Marshal of the Mark, and was a strong leader of\nMen. He was honored highly, prized extensively by the king, and was good\nfriends with Théodred, son of Théoden who loved him like a brother.\n\nHis éored hunted down the Uruk-hai that had taken Meriadoc Brandybuck\nand Peregrin Took as they camped near Fangorn forest, slaying them all.\nHe never saw the Hobbits, as they had fled during the battle. Afterwards\nhe met Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas in the plains of Rohan, and he lent\nthem two horses, Arod and Hasufel.\n\nÉomer returned to Edoras and reported on meeting the Ranger and friends\nand allowing them to go free, a violation of the king's law. Under the\npoisonous advice of Gríma Wormtongue, he was imprisoned by Théoden, who\nhad grown weak, aged, and suspicious under Saruman the White's\ninfluence.\n\nAfter Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas reunited with Gandalf, the four\nhastened to Edoras, where Gandalf broke Saruman's influence over Théoden\nand restored him to health and vitality. Théoden freed Éomer, who\noffered his sword to Théoden in token of his loyalty. Théoden named\nÉomer his heir prior to riding away from Edoras to the defense of the\nHornburg.\n\n[]\n\nAt the Battle of the Hornburg, he and his éored drove the orcs and\nDunlendings of Saruman into the walls of the Glittering Caves and in the\nHuorn forest, where they were killed. One of the main defences that\nÉomer was involved in was the defence of the gate where he, Aragorn, and\na small band of men left through a small door at the side of the\nHornburg and led an assault on the forces attempting to break the gates\nof the Hornburg. After this attack Éomer and Aragorn attempted to return\nthrough the door when Éomer was jumped upon by several orcs who had laid\nlow during the assault though Éomer was saved by Gimli who had secretly\nfollowed him out to the gate.\n\nAfterwards he rode with Théoden, Aragorn, and Gandalf to Isengard, where\nthey were greeted by Merry and Pippin, who were celebrating their recent\nvictory. Treebeard and his fellow Ents, remained as well in order to\nguard the now imprisoned Saruman and Wormtongue.\n\nAfter the “Warning beacons of Gondor” were lit, Théoden agreed to gather\nwhat forces he had to help defend the city of Minas Tirith against the\nimpending battle with the forces of Mordor. Théoden and Eomer manged to\nrally six thousand soldiers, before travelling to “The White City”. The\narmies of Rohan, manged to arrive at the Pelennor Fields, just before\nthe City Gates could be breached. Eomer fought gallantly, slaying many\nfoes. But Théoden was fatally crushed by his horse, Snowmane, after\nbeing thrown by the Witch King's Fell Beast. Coming upon their corpses,\nEomer was driven to temporary madness at seeing Éowyn, his sister, among\nthe King's retinue, apparently dead, and charged in renewed fury at the\nforces of Mordor. He and Aragorn met on the battlefield and reaffirmed\ntheir loyalty to each other, before returning to the long, grim work of\nwinning the battle.\n\nIn the battle's aftermath, Éomer attended to Éowyn in the Houses of\nHealing, and, with Aragorn and Meriadoc Brandybuck, helped call his\nsister Éowyn back to consciousness. Aragorn said that, as broken as\nEowyn's heart had been over her unrequited love for Aragorn, her love\nfor her brother was much more real to her, and a much more potent reason\nfor her to live.\n\nÉomer became King of the Mark upon Théoden's death. Following the\nbattle, Éomer and his men went back to Edoras to attend to affairs of\nthe kingdom, returning later to bear the body of Théoden back to his\nhome for burial.\n\n\n\nÉomer renewed the Oath of Eorl with Aragorn after Aragorn had been\ncrowned King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom, and Éomer had been crowned\nKing of Rohan, swearing everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor\n(and legalizing Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the Éothéod.)\n\nHe became known as ÉOMER ÉADIG, or “the Blessed”, because during his\nreign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and\nfruitful land again.\n\nÉomer had met Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth during\nhis stay in Gondor, and they were wed. She bore him a son Elfwine, who\nsucceeded his father, after Éomer's death in the year FO 63.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nÉomer's sword was called _Gúthwinë_ (Old English for “battle-friend”).\nHe also used a spear.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ÉOMER_ means “one who is famous in terms of horses” (Old English). The\nidea for his name was derived from the Anglo-Saxon words “eoh”\n(“war-horse”), “maer” (famous), and “éadig” (“blessed”).",

    "text": "CÍRDAN, also known as NOWË and CÍRDAN THE SHIPWRIGHT, was a Telerin Elf\n(of which he was one of the wisest princes), a great mariner and\nshipwright in Middle-earth.\n\nCírdan was the lord of the Falas and then of the Balar during much of\nthe First Age, one of the wisest and perhaps the mightiest of the\nMoriquendi. He was the bearer of the Great Ring Narya, which he in turn\ngave to Gandalf.\n\nHe was kin to both Elwë and Olwë. He may have also been related to Elmo,\nthe lesser known brother of Elwë.\n\nHe is one of the three oldest living elves in Middle-earth at the end of\nthe Third Age, along with Galadriel and Celeborn, who were all born\nduring the Years of the Trees. At the end of the Third Age, there were\nno other elves who had been alive at the start of the First Age. Círdan\nis one of two elves, the other being Celeborn, to have spent the most\ntime in Middle-Earth of any elf by being present in more ages than any\nother elf. Círdan and Celeborn were in Arda from sometime late in the\nYears of the Trees, through the First Age, until the Fourth Age. Tolkien\nhas written that Círdan would sail on the last ship into the West, as he\nis the Lord of the Grey Havens. So, it can thus be known that Círdan had\nthe longest incarnated single life span of any elf, having entered Arda\nduring the Years of the Trees and having left for Valinor later in the\nFourth Age than any other Elf.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\nAfter the Teleri Elves Arrive to Aman\n\nIn the First Age, Círdan was a ruler of a host of the Teleri under Elwë,\nand during the long wait in Beleriand he fell in love with the sea. When\nUlmo returned for the Teleri, Círdan and his followers remained behind,\npartially because of their love for Belegaer, and partially because of\nhis kinship with Elwë, who was lost. After Elwë returned and became King\nThingol, Círdan ruled the Falathrim of the havens of Eglarest and\nBrithombar, although he seemed to have accepted Thingol's overlordship.\nLater he became an advisor and friend of Finrod Felagund, Lord of\nNargothrond, although the Falas remained independent.\n\n\n\nWars of Beleriand\n\nCírdan was early on warned by Ulmo not to attempt a crossing to Valinor,\nand his mariners restricted their work to the coasts of Middle-earth.\nHowever, at the request of King Turgon of Gondolin, he later built\nseveral messenger ships to sail to Valinor to request help from the\nValar against Morgoth. All these missions failed, and only one survivor\never returned. After the havens of the Falas were destroyed by FA 474,\nCírdan was instrumental in setting up the refuges at the Mouths of\nSirion and the Isle of Balar, to which he retired for the remainder of\nthe age. It was on this isle that he built the great ship Vingilot for\nEärendil.\n\nSecond Age\n\nIn the Second Age, Círdan stayed behind when the Elves were summoned to\nValinor, and set up the havens of Forlond, Harlond and Mithlond in the\ndestroyed land of Lindon (anciently Ossiriand). Círdan's exact status\nduring that time is unknown, but it seems certain he served as\nlieutenant of Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor of\nMiddle-earth. Círdan is mentioned as receiving the ships of the\nNúmenóreans as they returned to the north of Middle-earth, and also as\nbeing one of the only two elves (along with Elrond) who stood beside\nGil-galad during his last battle with Sauron.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nFrom the Third Age onwards, after the fall of Gil-galad and the\nbeginning of the Age of Men, Círdan remained at the Grey Havens of\nMithlond where he was lord, and built ships which ferried the departing\nElves to Valinor. Círdan had possession of the one of the Three Elven\nRings, Narya, but when the Wizards or Istari arrived in the early Third\nAge he recognised Olórin's wisdom, and gave him his ring.\n\nCírdan remained active behind the scenes, sending counsellors to the\nWhite Council at Rivendell, but following the War of the Ring he was\nseen to have prepared the ship that ferried across the other\nRing-bearers: Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo, and Frodo in the last\nyear of the Third Age. It is uncertain whether he left Middle-earth\nhimself on the same ship: he is not mentioned as boarding, and later\nletters by Tolkien imply he remained behind. There are contradictory\nreferences to the Fate of the Elves of Middle-earth scattered throughout\nTolkien's works, and it may be that Círdan's role as a facilitator for\nelves returning to the Blessed Realm continued for some time. There\nis one line that says that Círdan would remain until the last ship set\nsail for the west.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nCírdan had a beard, which was rare for Elves, and silver hair like\nThingol his overlord and kinsman. He was of great age at the time of the\nWar of the Ring: perhaps the oldest of the Telerin Elves or even of all\nthe elves remaining in Middle-earth. He may have been one of the elves\nwho awoke near Cuiviénen and therefore without a mother or father.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Círdan_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Ship-maker', and the Quenya\nform was said to be _CIRYATAN_. His original name was probably _NOWË_,\nwhich may be related to the term _nowo_ meaning “think, form idea,\nimagine.”",

Eorl was a wise and valiant\nman and a great hero of his people. He had ruddy skin and blond hair\nthat remained golden throughout his life.\n\nEorl was born in TA 2485. His father was Léod, the leader of the people\ncalled the Éothéod who lived in the far north near the source of the\nAnduin. In TA 2501 when Eorl was sixteen years old, Léod was killed by a\nwild horse that he had tried to tame; for this act the horse was called\nMansbane by the Éothéod. Eorl hunted the horse and rather than kill him\nrequired that the horse serve him and surrender his freedom as a\nweregild. The horse submitted and Eorl renamed him Felaróf. Felaróf\nbecame Eorl's steed and was the father of the Mearas, who were the\nsteeds of Eorl's descendants. It was also said that Felaróf would not\npermit any other man to ride him.\n\nEorl succeeded his father as the leader of the Éothéod. They were a\nnumerous people with many horses. They needed more room to roam, but\nthere was nowhere for them to go.\n\nOn March 25, TA 2510 - when Eorl was twenty-five years old - an\nerrand-rider named Borondir arrived with a message from Cirion, the\nSteward of Gondor. Gondor was being threatened by Men from Rhun called\nthe Balchoth, and Cirion sought Eorl's help in defeating them. Eorl\nagreed to come, because he knew that if Gondor fell, all of Middle-earth\nwould soon be conquered. Borondir was one of several errand riders sent\nout by the Stewards, but the only one to get through, due to the\nintervening enemies. Eorl assembled his Council of Elders to prepare to\nride south.\n\nOn April 6 , Eorl rode forth with an Éored - or mounted army - of 7,000\nfully armed Riders and several hundred mounted archers. Only a few\nhundred Riders were left behind to guard the women, children, and\nelderly. The eohere rode southward through the Vales of the Anduin - a\njourney of over 500 miles.\n\nWhen they passed Dol Guldur in Mirkwood - where Sauron dwelled in secret\n- a darkness emanated from the fortress, and Eorl turned westward to\navoid it. But then a white mist came from the woods of Lothlorien that\nstood across the River from Dol Guldur, and the Riders were hidden and\ncontinued safely on their way and, under the protection of the mist,\napparently made the journey unwearyingly at an extraordinary rate of\nspeed.\n\nEorl arrived at the Field of Celebrant on the morning of April 15.\nGondor's army was being attacked on two fronts by the Balchoth and orcs\nfrom the Misty Mountains. Eorl and his Riders attacked the enemy from\nthe rear, slaying many and driving the rest across the River Limlight.\nSouth of the Limlight lay the province of Gondor called Calenardhon, and\nEorl and his Riders pursued the surviving enemies until the land was\nfree of them.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, Eorl accompanied Cirion to\nthe Mering Stream on the southeastern border of Calenardhon, where they\nparted company. Cirion asked Eorl to meet him there again in three\nmonths and committed Calenardhon to Eorl's care in the meantime.\n\n\n\nWhen they met again in August of 2510, Cirion brought Eorl to\nHalifirien, the Hill of Awe (also known as Amon Anwar because, unknown\nto all but the Steward and those in his deepest confidence, the Tomb of\nElendil had stood since being placed there by Isildur after the fall of\nSauron, in the Firien wood). There Cirion offered Eorl the land of\nCalenardhon as a new homeland for his people in gratitude for their\nservice to Gondor. Eorl was deeply grateful for the Gift of Cirion, whom\nhe admired as the wisest of all men then in Middle-earth. He accepted\nand he swore an Oath that his people would always come to Gondor's aid\nin time of need. Eorl realized that their peoples needed to remain\nallies in order to face the growing danger in Middle-earth. Cirion took\na similar oath on behalf of the people of Gondor.\n\nEorl left about half his force to guard Calenardhon and returned to the\nfar north to gather his people and their possessions. He led them back\nto their new homeland, and it became known as the Mark. In Gondor, the\nnew land of their allies was called Rohan.\n\nEorl was King of the Mark for 35 years. He chose the hill at the\nentrance to the valley of Harrowdale to be the site of the town of\nEdoras. But Meduseld, the Golden Hall, was not completed in Eorl's\nlifetime, and he dwelled at Aldburg in the Folde. Eorl's son Brego was\nborn in TA 2512.\n\nIn TA 2545, Rohan was attacked by Easterlings. The attack was thwarted,\nbut Eorl fell in battle. He was buried in a mound outside Edoras, and\nhis horse Felarof was buried with him. His son Brego succeeded him as\nKing of Rohan.\n\nRohan continued to be ruled by the House of Eorl, and the people of\nRohan called themselves the Eorlingas, or the Sons of Eorl. The Oath of\nEorl was not forgotten. During the War of the Ring, King Theoden of\nRohan honored his ancestor's Oath and came to Gondor's aid at the Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields. The Oath of Eorl was renewed by Theoden's\nsuccessor King Eomer, who pledged continued friendship to Aragorn, King\nElessar, of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.",

    "text": "THRANDUIL, son of Oropher, was an Elven king who ruled over the Woodland\nRealm in the Second and Third Ages. Though inherently cautious, he\neventually committed his kingdom to fighting against Sauron in the War\nof the Ring. He was the father of the Elven prince of Mirkwood, Legolas,\nwho was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Thranduil is only referred to as the ELVENKING.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nThranduil was the only son of Oropher, the King of the Woodland Realm.\nHe was born sometime during the First and Second Age. At the beginning\nof the Second Age, the Sindar travelled east and Oropher eventually\nfounded Greenwood the Great.\n\nIn SA 3434, Thranduil and his father fought in the Battle of Dagorlad.\nOropher was slain and Thranduil returned to Greenwood with roughly a\nthird of the army that had marched to war. He claimed his inheritance\nand some time before TA 1000 inherited Oropher's title of King of the\nWoodland Realm, reigning over the south of Greenwood the Great. \n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of Thranduil's reign his kingdom encompassed all of\nGreenwood the Great and was known as the Woodland Realm, but as the\nThird Age progressed, the shadow of the Necromancer advanced, and the\nGreenwood grew dark and became known as Mirkwood, and became infested\nwith Orcs and giant spiders. The Wood-elves of Mirkwood were reduced in\nnumber and retreated to lands in the north of Mirkwood. By the time of\nthe events of _The Lord of the Rings_ Thranduil's title was _King of the\nElves of Northern Mirkwood_.\n\nIn his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken, though not\nall members of his Woodland folk spoke Sindarin.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\nWhen Thorin Oakenshield and his party of Dwarves entered northern\nMirkwood, Thranduil captured Thorin and locked him up in a secure room\nwhen he refused to divulge his true intentions. The Dwarves were\ntreated well, with plenty of food and drink. Subsequently, when the rest\nof the Dwarves had been captured by the elves, Thranduil had them\nunbound and treated them as his guests (save that they were not allowed\nto leave the caverns), until they angered him by being surly and\nimpolite, insulting him for keeping them as prisoners, and not revealing\nwhy they had entered the forest, after which he gave them each their own\ncell. He did not tell them that Thorin was also his prisoner.\n\n\n\nAfter the death of the Dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the\nBowman's claim of a share of the treasure the dwarves recovered from the\nLonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and\nthe treasure of that town had been taken by Smaug to the Lonely\nMountain.\n\nThranduil led the elven forces in the Battle of the Five Armies. His\narmy was position on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the\nfirst to charge.\n\nAfter the battle and of Thorin's death, Thranduil took Orcrist, which\nwas previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb.\nThe treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the\nemeralds of Girion. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the elf-host\nback to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil\nasked them to.\n\nWhen Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of\nsilver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of “elf-friend” and\nreturned with his host in their halls.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, he sent his son Legolas to Rivendell, along\nwith other Elves, to report Gollum's escape from Mirkwood. The\ngradually-established friendship between the dwarf Gimli and Legolas\nlater helped to reconcile Thranduil's people with the Dwarves.\n\nWhen the forces from Dol Guldur later attacked Mirkwood, Thranduil\nrepulsed an attack and had the victory. His actions were in concert with\nthe Dwarves and the Men of Dale against the Easterlings who attacked\nfrom the East. He came into an agreement with Celeborn that the southern\npart of Mirkwood would be counted as East Lórien. Thranduil took the\nnorthern region as far as the mountains; the wide forest between\nMirkwood and East Lórien was given to the Beornings. By this time also,\nThranduil renamed Mirkwood _Eryn Lasgalen_, the Wood of Greenleaves.\n\nFourth Age\n\nAfter the fall of Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of his\nrealm as the Mountains of Mirkwood, and his realm flourished well into\nthe Fourth Age. He may have stayed on as the king of the Great\nForest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_THRANDUIL_ is a Sindarin word for “Vigorous spring”, from _tharan_\n(“vigorous”) and _ethuil_ (“spring”). It was said that the name\n“Thranduil” was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along\nwith other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Amroth among\nothers.\n\nTitles\n\nThranduil first appears as a character in _The Hobbit,_ where he is not\nnamed. Tolkien refers to him as _the elf-king_ or _the king,_ and\nalso by the titles ELVENKING and KING OF THE ELVES OF THE WOOD. The\nname _Thranduil_ first appears in _The Lord of the Rings,_ in which his\ntitle was given as the KING OF THE ELVES OF NORTHERN MIRKWOOD.\nElsewhere in Tolkien's writings he was also referred to as KING OF THE\nWOODLAND REALM, a title he inherited from his father.",

    "race": "Hobbits",
    "text": "MERIADOC “MERRY” BRANDYBUCK (later known as Meriadoc “Merry” Brandybuck\nI, due to his grandson's birth) was a Hobbit and one of Frodo's cousins\nand closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest\nin the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one of the nine companions in\nThe Fellowship of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nMerry was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck\n(TA 2940 - FO 11), Master of Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?),\nthe younger sister of Paladin Took II , making him first cousin to\nPaladin's son Pippin, who was clearly his closest friend.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMerry was considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits,\nfor example, even before Frodo Baggins leaves the Shire, he knew of the\nOne Ring and its power. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party,\nprotecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was\nthe force behind “the Conspiracy” of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger (more\ncommonly known as “Fatty”, due to his plump form) and himself to help\nFrodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring begins, Merry was well\nprepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. His\nshortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided\nthe Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the\nBarrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.\n\n\n\nAt Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly\nput on the ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by\nthe Nazgûl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and\nplotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a\nlittle less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two to relay news to\nthe people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf,\nbelieving in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam,\nrequested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen\nhe was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's\nfighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir\nvaliantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.\n\nEscaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen\nGandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant\namounts of Entwash, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair\ngrowth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he\nand Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here\nthat Merry encountered King Théoden of Rohan, and was reunited with the\nremaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).\n\n\n\nSeparated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry\nswore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from\nhis liege, he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of\nyoung Dernhelm (who was actually Éowyn, though Merry didn't know it).\nWhen Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Théoden was injured, Merry\nand Éowyn faced the Witch King of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion\nrevealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both fell beast and the Nazgûl\nalone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, built\nfor this very purpose, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the\nRingwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He cut the Witch\nKing behind the knee as he was about to kill Eowyn. This was enough to\nallow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last\nwords, but went unnoticed by the honour escort of Riders and was found\nwandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and\nrecovered fully.\n\nFor his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan,\nknighted him and gave him the name of “Holdwine”. During the Scouring of\nthe Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the\nHorn of Rohan presented to him by Éowyn.\n\nLegacy\n\nUpon their return he and Pippin both got married to beautiful hobbit\nwomen. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the\nslightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Bandobras\n“Bullroarer” Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Entwater.\nMerry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age.\nHe became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11). He wrote _Old Words\nand Names in the Shire._ Although he was not recorded as having any\nchildren within the family trees, he clearly had at least one son. At\nthe age of 102, he returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there\naround the year FO 64. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar\ndied in the Fourth Age 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great\nking.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nSword\n\nMerry uses a short barrow-blade for melee combat in books and video\ngames, but in the movies he loses his barrow blade and instead wields\na Rohirrim short sword and wears a helmet, shield and leather jerkin\nthat were originally made for the young King Theoden. The\nblade dissolved during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields when it was\nused to stab the Witch-king of Angmar (Ringwraith, King of the Nazgûl).\n\nThrowing Weapons\n\nMerry can use rocks to hit opponents from a distance. In _The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Return of the King (video game)_, he uses throwing knives\ninstead of rocks, like all other Hobbits. In his case, however, his\ndaggers are slightly stronger.",

    "name": "Ungoliant",
    "lotr_page_id": "2378",
    "text": "UNGOLIANT (Sindarin IPA: - “Dark Spider”) was a primordial taking the\nshape of a gigantic spider. She was initially an ally of Melkor in Aman,\nand for a short time in Middle-earth as well. She is the mother of\nShelob, and therefore the oldest, and first spider of the south,\npossibly even the first spider of Arda. Biography Origins The true\norigin of Ungoliant is unknown, and was not even known by the Valar. It\nis said by some that she came from the Darkness itself that lies about\nArda and was once an ally of Melkor when he looked down upon the world\nwith envy. Later, she changed her allegiance from him to herself,\ndesiring only to be a mistress of her own insatiable craving to devour\nall light - to feed her everlasting emptiness. Early years When Melkor\nwas defeated and imprisoned by the Lords of the West after the first\nElves awoke in Cuiviénen, Ungoliant escaped the attacks of the Valar and\nthe hunters of Oromë and fled to the southern part of Aman. There, in a\nravine south of the mountain Hyarmentir, she established her dark abode\nand took the physical form of a monstrous spider, and sucked up all the\nlight she could find. After every feeding, she spun forth dark nets of\ngloom that strangled any light from entering her lair of darkness. Yet\nshe hungered for more of it: for although she hated light, she craved\nits sustenance as well. Alliance with Melkor Eventually, Melkor sought\nout Ungoliant in order to exact his revenge against the Valar and the\nElves. He came to her and told her of his plans. Though she was tempted\ngreatly by Melkor's plan for her to drink the light of the Two Trees of\nValinor, she feared the power of the Valar and was hesitant to accompany\nhim. To mollify her, Melkor offered to sate her hunger with whatever she\nwished if she would aid him in his vengeance. She agreed, and they came\nshortly thereafter to Ezellohar, where she drained the Trees of their\nsap, poisoned them, and drank the Wells of Varda dry. The Unlight\nproduced by Ungoliant stymied the pursuit of Oromë and Tulkas, and\nMelkor escaped to Middle-earth with her. However, her consumption of\npower of the Trees and the Wells caused her to swell to a size and shape\nso vast and hideous that even Melkor began to grow afraid. When they\narrived in Lammoth in Middle-earth, Melkor, now known as Morgoth, hoped\nto escape to the ruins of Angband where the remnants of his forces\nawaited him. Suspecting that he intended to leave his promise to her\nunfulfilled, Ungoliant demanded the gems that Morgoth had stolen from\nFormenos before they could reach Angband. She devoured them, and grew to\nan even more monstrous size. She then demanded that Morgoth surrender to\nher the Silmarils. However, Morgoth refused, and she attacked him.\nWeaving her dark webs, she attempted to enmesh him in her nets and take\nthe Silmarils by force. Morgoth gave out a terrible cry of pain as she\nattacked, which was heard by the Balrogs hibernating under the ruins of\nAngband. They awoke and immediately rushed to the aid of their Lord,\ntearing apart Ungoliant's webbing with their fiery whips and forcing her\nto break off her attack. She fled, and the Balrogs prepared to pursue\nand destroy her, but they were checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to\nreturn with him to Angband. Ungoliant's attack upon Morgoth left an\nechoing scream ever after on the land that gave the area the name\nLammoth, and it is said to this day that when one screams in that place,\nthe voice of the Dark Lord echoes back from the surrounding hills. Final\nYears and Legacy Driven off by the Balrogs, Ungoliant fled to Nan\nDungortheb, where she bred with the Great Spiders that dwelt there,\nincreasing the terror and power of her kind. The creatures that later\ninfested the area were her surviving offspring and descendants,\nincluding her infamous daughter, Shelob, who dwelt from the Second and\nThird Ages onwards on the borders of Mordor, as her last surviving\nchild. It is said that Ungoliant ultimately perished at her own hands\nwhen, in her ever growing and eternal hunger, she eventually devoured\nherself. Others say Ungoliant, after retreating to an isolated island in\nthe Belegaer, was slain by Eärendil, and with her darkness destroyed,\nlight came to many regions from which it had long been hid. Towards the\nend of the First Age, she had captured the sun (Arien/Urwendi) with her\ngloom nets and Earendil encountered her on his journey across the seas\non the Vingilot. Earendil ultimately freed Urwendi freeing the Magic\nSun.Similarly, Tolkien projected a tale wherein Ungoliant ensnared the\nSun in her webs while it sailed under the earth: with the result that\nthe Sun was no longer enchanted, only the Moon: Urwendi imprisoned by\nMóru (upset out of the boat by Melko and only the Moon has been magic\nsince). The Faring Forth and the Battle of Erumáni would release her and\nrekindle the Magic Sun. Tolkien, J. R. R.; John D. Rateliff.

Kindle Edition.\nEtymology The name _Ungoliant_ in Quenya is UNGWELIANTË, which means\n“Dark Spider”, from _ungwë_ (“dark”) and _liantë_ (“spider”). UNGOLIANT\nis the Sindarin translation of her Quenya name. Other names The Eldar\ncalled her VIRILOMË (WIRILOMË in Vanyarin) or GLOOMWEAVER. In Sindarin,\nthis name is translated into GWERLUM.",

    "name": "Arwen",
    "race": "Elves",
    "text": "ARWEN was the Half-Elven daughter of Elrond and Celebrían. She was often\ncalled ARWEN UNDÓMIEL or “EVENSTAR”.\n\nIn marrying Aragorn II Elessar after the War of the Ring, she became\nQueen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, and like Beren and\nLúthien before her, she united Elf and Man in peaceful love and harmony,\nin the process becoming mortal.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nArwen was born in TA 241, to Lord Elrond and Lady Celebrían of\nRivendell. Like her father and brothers, she had the right to choose\nbetween immortality or mortal life. She lived most of her life in\nRivendell and Lothlórien interchangeably.\n\nThird Age\n\nAragorn and Arwen\n\n\n\nDuring Aragorn's twentieth year, he met Arwen for the first time in\nRivendell, where he lived under Elrond's protection. Arwen, then over\n2700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living\nfor a while with her grandmother Galadriel in Lórien. Aragorn fell in\nlove with Arwen at first sight, and at first mistook her for Lúthien,\nthinking he had fallen into a dream.\n\nAbout thirty years later, the two were reunited in Lórien, where Arwen\nreciprocated Aragorn's love and they “plighted their troth” (promised\nthemselves to each other) on the mound of Cerin Amroth, choosing to\nbecome mortal and to stay in Middle-earth with Aragorn, and giving up\nthe chance to sail over the sea and live forever in the Blessed Realm.\nArwen never broke faith with Aragorn, even when he went to war. While\nthe War in the South raged on, Arwen wove a banner for Aragorn, which\nwould become his standard after he became king.\n\n\n\nBefore taking the Paths of the Dead, Aragorn was met by a group\nconsisting of Dúnedain, and Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir. They\nbrought to him a banner of black cloth: a gift made by Arwen, and a sign\nthat encouraged him to take the difficult path. When the banner was\nunfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblem of\nElendil in Mithril, gems, and gold, it was the first triumphant\nannouncement of the King's return.\n====After the War==== \n\nArwen arrived at Minas Tirith after Aragorn had become King of Gondor\nand Arnor, and they married on Midsummer's Day in the year TA 3019,\nafter the end of the War of the Ring. She became Queen of the Reunited\nKingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. After marrying Aragorn, she bestowed upon\nFrodo Baggins a gift: Her place on the ships to Valinor. She bore\nAragorn's son, Eldarion, and several unnamed daughters, some time during\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFourth Age\n\nIn the year 121 of the Fourth Age, after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of\na broken heart at Cerin Amroth in Lórien, and was buried there one\nyear after the death of Aragorn, to whom she had been wedded for 122\nyears. She was 2901 years old.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Arwen_ means “Noble Maiden”, from the Sindarin word _ar(a)_\n(“royal, noble”) and _wen_ (“maiden”). Her epessë UNDÓMIEL means\n“Evenstar”, from the Quenya _Undómë_ (“evening twilight”) and _el_\n(“star”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nArwen was described to be the most beautiful of the last generation of\nHigh Elves in Middle-Earth, and was even said to bear a remarkable\nresemblance to her ancestress, Lúthien. Tolkien described Arwen as\nfollowing:\n\n_On Fellowship of the Ring's film version, Arwen proved wise. She proved\ncourage and kind as shown when she risked her own life and defied the\nNazgul to protect Frodo as well as acting to heal Frodo's wounds. She\nalso showed a great sense of humour when she traded barbs with Aragorn.\nShe also loved Aragorn so much she was ready to give up immortality so\nshe can be with him._\n\n\nLineage\n\nArwen was the youngest child of Elrond and Celebrían; her elder brothers\nwere the twins Elladan and Elrohir. Through her father, she was the\ngranddaughter of Eärendil the Mariner (the second of the Half-Elven),\ngreat-granddaughter of Tuor of Gondolin, and therefore a direct\ndescendant of the ancient House of Hador. Arwen was also a descendant of\nKing Turgon of the Ñoldor through her great-grandmother, Idril. Through\nher mother, she was the granddaughter of Lady Galadriel and the\ngreat-granddaughter of Finarfin. Éomer of Rohan said that the Lady Arwen\nwas more fair than the Lady Galadriel of Lórien, but Gimli son of Glóin\nthought differently. Through both of her parents Arwen was a direct\ndescendant of the ancient Elven House of Finwë. Furthermore, Arwen was a\ndescendant of Beren and Lúthien Tinúviel, whose story resembled hers.\nIndeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of her\nancestress Lúthien, fairest of all the Elves, who was called Nightingale\n(Tinúviel).\n\n\n\nArwen was a very distant relative of her husband Aragorn. Aragorn's\nancestor, Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor, was her father\nElrond's brother, who chose to live as a man rather than one of the\nEldar. This means that Aragorn also has very distant Elvish ancestry.\nElros died in SA 442, some 3240 years before Arwen was born.\n\nArwen eventually became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of\nArnor.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring ended, Arwen and Aragorn produced the future\nheir of the throne, Eldarion.\n\nBy Arwen and Aragorn's marriage, the long-sundered lines of the\nHalf-elven were joined. Their union also served to unite and preserve\nthe bloodlines of the Three Kings of the High Elves (Ingwë, Finwë, and\nthe brothers Olwë and Elwë) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood\nthrough Arwen's great-great-great grandmother, Melian, Queen of Doriath,\nand also on Aragorn's side, through the line of kings of Arnor and\nNúmenor to Elros, Elrond's brother, whose great-great-grandmother was\nalso Melian.",

    "text": "ÉOWYN was a shieldmaiden of Rohan, daughter of Éomund and Theodwyn,\nyounger sister of Éomer and niece of King Théoden. After the War of the\nRing, she married Faramir and had one son with him, Elboron.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nÉowyn was the second child of Éomund and Theodwyn. Like her brother\nÉomer, she was related to King Théoden through their mother, the King's\nsister. Her father was slain and her mother died of illness in TA 3002.\nAfterwards, Théoden took Éomer and Éowyn in his household and raised\nthem as his children.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Éowyn was forced to stay in Meduseld and\ncare for her declining uncle for several years, as he was weakened by\nthe influence of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. When Gandalf restored the\nKing, he prepared to defend Rohan against Isengard. Since Théoden\nplanned to ride to battle himself, he asked his doorwarden Háma, to\nsuggest a leader for the people in his absence. Háma recommended Éowyn,\nwho, though a woman, was “fearless” and “all love her.”\n\nÉowyn reluctantly obeyed the King's orders to stay behind in Edoras\nwhile Aragorn, Théoden, and the rest of the men confronted Saruman's\narmy at the Battle of the Hornburg. When they returned, victorious to\nEdoras, Éowyn had kept everything in perfect order for their return. It\nwas near this time when she confessed her growing feelings for Aragorn,\nbut he reluctantly refused.\n\nWhen Denethor II urgently called for Théoden's aid against Mordor, Éowyn\nagain, begged to be allowed to ride with Aragorn to battle, but he\nrefused.\n\nIn bitterness, she disguised herself as a man, under the alias Dernhelm,\nand rode to Minas Tirith on her horse Windfola. She took Meriadoc\nBrandybuck along because he likewise wanted to follow his friends to\nbattle, but had been refused by Théoden. Because Éowyn weighed less than\na man of similar height, Windfola was able to bear both her and\nMerry.  During the Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields, she fought in Théoden's escort; when he and his\ncompany were attacked by the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the Nazgûl,\nshe and Merry were the only riders who did not flee. As Théoden lay\nmortally wounded, she challenged the Witch-King, who boasted that “no\nliving man may hinder me.” In answer, she removed her helmet, exposing\nher long blond hair, and declared, _“No living man am I! You look upon a\nwoman! Éowyn I am, Éomund's daughter. Begone if you be not deathless!\nFor living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him!”_\n\nIn a rage, the Witch-king attacked her, but she cleaved the head off his\nFell Beast. The Witch-king shattered her shield with a blow of his mace,\nbreaking her arm, but stumbled when Merry stabbed his leg from behind\nwith a Barrow-blade of Westernesse make. Éowyn stabbed her sword through\nthe Witch-king's head, killing him, and thus fulfilling Glorfindel's\nprophecy a thousand years earlier at the Battle of Fornost that “not by\nthe hand of man” would the Witch-King fall.\n\n\n\nHer constitution already severely weakened by her loneliness and\ndespair, combined with her physical injuries, Éowyn succumbed to a\nsevere case of the Black Breath. Théoden, not knowing that she was\nnearby, told Merry with his dying words that she had been “dearer than\ndaughter” to him.\n\nSeeing her lying apparently dead on the battlefield caused her brother\nÉomer to go temporarily mad, and charge in fury at the enemy. But during\nthe battle she was found by Prince Imrahil, who noticed that she was\nstill alive, though barely, and ordered her taken to the Houses of\nHealing. There she was healed by Aragorn, the cure of the plant Athelas,\nand the entreaties of her distraught brother.\n\n\n\nÉowyn remained behind in Minas Tirith while the Army of the West marched\ntoward Morannon, the Black Gate, to challenge Sauron. She met and fell\nin love with Faramir, who had likewise been injured before the battle.\nAfter the War of the Ring had ended, she decided to give up dreams of\nglory in battle and devote her life to peace and a happy marriage.\n\nLater years\n\nAt Éowyn's insistence, Merry was made a Knight of the Riddermark. He\nattended Théoden's funeral and Éomer's coronation as King of Rohan,\nwhere Éowyn presented Merry with a parting gift: the Horn of Rohan, a\nsmall silver horn taken from the hoard of Scatha, the dragon.\n\nFaramir and Éowyn settled in Ithilien, where they had at least one son\n(likely Elboron), and their grandson was Barahir, who wrote _The Tale of\nAragorn and Arwen_ in the Fourth Age. The date of Éowyn's death is\nnowhere recorded.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Éowyn_ means “horse lover” in Anglo-Saxon (the language Tolkien used to\nrepresent Rohirric).\n\nThe name was derived from an old Welsh name, _Øwyn_ - slightly altered\nto sound like “A-O-win”. The name in Welsh means “Horse friend”, with\nthe prefix _Éo-_ meaning 'horse' and the suffix ''-wyn ''(“whün”)\nmeaning 'friend.'\n\nPronunciation\n\nThe first syllable of Éowyn's name is pronounced “eh-ah,” with the “ah”\njust barely pronounced. The second syllable pronounced is slightly\ndifferent than it looks, however, being in Welsh it is pronounced “een;”\nthe sound it makes together in an “Eh-awe-een,” having the “w” barely\npronounced at all, instead the word creates its own soft “w” without the\nvoluntary sound, as in Welsh “w” is considered to be a vowel. As in\nScandinavian, the “y” in the second syllable is the same sound as the\nGerman letter _“ü”_ or the French \"_u\"_.\n\nTitles\n\nÉowyn's title was “LADY OF ROHAN” and was also known as “The White Lady\nof Rohan” due to her pale complexion. She also used the alias “DERNHELM”\nwhile riding with Rohan's army, and after her wounding by the Witch-king\nin the Pelennor Fields as “Lady of the Shield-arm”. After her\nmarriage to Faramir she was called the Lady of Ithilien (in contrast to\nFaramir, who was styled Prince of Ithilien), and LADY OF EMYN ARNEN.",

    "text": "ECTHELION, or ECTHELION OF THE FOUNTAIN, was a mighty lord of Gondolin\nduring the First Age of Middle-earth, and one of its greatest heroes.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nMost of Ecthelion's early life is unknown but he might have lived in\nAman in Tirion and might have been one of the followers of Fingolfin.He\npassed through the dangerous Helcaraxe and lived. After he survived the\ngrinding ice, he settled in Vinyamar in Nevrast before moving to\nGondolin in FA 116. He later became lord of the house of the fountain.\n\nAredhel's Escort\n\nTwo hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and\nEgalmoth, along with the White Lady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City\ndue to Aredhel's yearning for the freedom she once had in Valinor. Their\norders were to lead her towards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder\nbrother Fingon. When coming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered\nthem to turn south, for she desired to see the Sons of Fëanor. Thus,\nEcthelion and his companions sought admittance to Doriath, but the\nwardens refused them entrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no\nother choice, they took the dangerous road between the haunted valleys\nof Ered Gorgoroth. Near Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death,\nthe riders were caught in a mesh of shadows and they were lost from\nAredhel. In vain, they sought her afterwards, but the fell offspring of\nUngoliant that dwelt in that place pursued them. Barely escaping alive,\nthe three lords returned to Gondolin without the princess, where they\nwere received in sorrow.\n\nA Lord of Gondolin\n\nIn the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon in the battle\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces. Upon the defeat\nof the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.\n\nTwenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of\nGondolin traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil\nthrough the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the\nGreat Gate.\n\nEcthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor made a\nreference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion eventually\nallowed him entry.\n\n\n\nHe was the leader of the House of the Fountain, one of the Twelve Houses\nof the Gondolindrim. His people were fond of diamonds and silver, their\narray was most beautiful to the sight. In FA 510 during the Fall of\nGondolin, Ecthelion led his house into battle accompanied by the music\nof their flutes and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their\nlong, bright swords.\n\nWarcry of the Eldar\n\nIn the battle over Gondolin, Ecthelion and his forces made their\nentrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in\nreserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the\nswords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror\namong the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by\nside with Tuor and his House of the Wing, they drove away the orcs until\nalmost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Morgoth's army,\nEcthelion killed three Balrogs and his sword did “hurt to their fire”.\nOutnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm\nwas wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they\njoined the remaining leaders in the Square of the King.\n\nIn that place, the great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion\nregained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the\nenemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began\nretreat. All but Ecthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand,\nwhich was remembered as the most valiant “in all the songs or in any\ntale”. It was there that he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs.\n\nBane of Gothmog\n\n\n\nTuor tried to stand in the way of Gothmog, but he was thrown aside. Then\nEcthelion, fairest of the Ñoldor, but whose face now had the pallor of\ngrey steel, dueled him. Losing his sword due to a wound received he was\nunable to protect himself. Just as Gothmog was about to deliver the\nfinishing blow, Ecthelion jumped and wrapped his legs around the demon,\ndriving the spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. This caused Gothmog\nto lose his balance, and he, along with Ecthelion, fell into the\nFountain of the King. Gothmog's fire was thus quenched, but Ecthelion\nalso drowned with him and found his death in cool waters, whose lord he\nwas.\n\nLater, a young Eärendil asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion\nwere there, “to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles!\nPerchance has he gone on ahead?” After he was informed of Ecthelion's\ndeath, he “wept bitterly” and said that he cared no more to see the\nstreets of Gondolin.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nAlthough it was never confirmed, it is largely believed that Ecthelion\nis the original owner of Orcrist. If so, it is interesting due to the\nfact that Orcrist and its mate Glamdring killed the two most famous\nBalrogs of all time - Glamdring later killing Durin's Bane, and Orcrist\nGothmog. If this is true, then it is also curious that all combatants\ndied during the Balrog battle.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are three different sources that offer a translation of ECTHELION\nand they all differ substantially.\n\n-   In _The Book of Lost Tales 2_ Appendix, it is said that the name\n    derives from the Quenya _ehtelë_ (“issue of water, spring”), a\n    reference to his title as Lord for the House of the Fountain.\n-   In the etymologies of _The Lost Road and Other Writings_, his name\n    is composed from _ehtë_, (“spear”) and _thela_, (“point”) (of\n    spear). Put together they would translate as “Spear-point” or\n    “Spear-head”.\n-   In _The War of the Jewels_, which seems to be the last matter J.R.R.\n    Tolkien wrote on it, the name is derived from _aeg_, (“sharp”) and\n    _thel_, (“intent, resolve”). This would translate “one of sharp\n    resolve”.",

    "lotr_page_id": "2623",
    "text": "HÚRIN, more commonly known as HÚRIN THALION and ÚMARTH, was a hero of\nMen during the First Age. He was the father of the tragic Túrin\nTurambar. According to _The Silmarillion_, he was the greatest warrior\nof Men in the First Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLife in Dor-lómin\n\nHúrin was a grandson of Hador, of the _House of Marach_ or _House of\nHador_. Húrin was the elder son of Galdor of the House of Marach and\nHareth of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Huor. He was known\nto be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the\nDragon-helm of Dor-lómin because it was too large on him to fit\nproperly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his\npeers.\n\nIn the year FA 458, Huor and Húrin dwelt with their kin in the forest of\nBrethil, when they joined a war party against Orcs. The brothers ended\nup in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by\norcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the\nbrothers escaped into Dimbar, there two Great Eagles picked them up, and\nbrought them to Gondolin. King Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers,\nremembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aid Gondolin\nin their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew\nto love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The\nbrothers swore an oath to keep Gondolin secret, and Eagles brought them\nback to Dor-Lómin.\n\nIn FA 462 Morgoth assailed Hithlum and Húrin's father Galdor the Tall\nfell defending the Ered Wethrin. Húrin chased the Orcs away with heavy\nlosses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, Húrin was the Lord of\nDor-lómin and ruled over the Hadorian fief of Dor-lómin in Hithlum.\n\nTwo years later, he wedded Morwen Elf-Sheen of the House of Bëor, and\nlater in the year was born their son Túrin. A daughter Lalaith followed,\nbut she died aged three years old by a plague sent from Angband.\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad\n\n\n\nIn FA 473, in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin fought alongside Huor and\nthe Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle, he met again with Turgon, and\ntheir meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, Húrin and Huor\ngathered all the remaining men of the House of Hador and they took a\nstand fighting off the Orcs, allowing Turgon to escape. Step by step,\nthe army of Morgoth pushed them back. They stepped back until the river\nRivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They\nkept on fighting until dusk when Huor was slain. In the end, Húrin stood\nthere alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he\ntook a grand battle-axe of an Orc captain. He waded alone into Gothmog's\nbodyguard of Trolls, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his\nvoice: ''“Aure entuluva!” ''(“Day will come again!”) This battle cry was\nheard seventy times. Húrin fought with the battle axe until the axe\nitself withered away from the caustic blood of the trolls he had been\nslaying. He was grappled by the orcs and taken hostage, even though he\nhewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. Húrin was brought captive to\nMorgoth, and despite horrific torture, he refused to reveal the location\nof Gondolin. Due to his defiance, Morgoth cursed him and his family to\nmisery and hopelessness.\n\nHúrin was placed high on the peaks of Thangorodrim, either chained or\nmagically immobilised in a seat where, through the power of Morgoth, he\ncould see all the evils that later befell his son Túrin. He never saw\nhis second daughter Nienor, who was born while he was a captive.\n\nRelease from captivity and death\n\n\n\nIn the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Morgoth released\nHúrin, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe. In reality however,\nMorgoth hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in\nHúrin throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause\nstrife and misfortune to those whom Húrin encountered. He was brought to\nhis old homelands in Hithlum, but the Easterlings now living there at\nfirst did not recognize him and later feared him, believing him to be\nhigh in Morgoth's favor. The House of Hador had been destroyed or\nenslaved. Seven outlaws joined Húrin, and together they went to the vale\nof Sirion, where he once had known Gondolin. Húrin abandoned the outlaws\nand sought for the entrance, but Gondolin was closed, and Turgon at\nfirst did not wish to allow Húrin in. Húrin cried out against Turgon,\nthus inadvertently revealing the general location of Gondolin to\nMorgoth's spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Turgon have a\nchange of heart and send Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and\ndid not find him.\n\nHúrin continued to the forest of Brethil where his son and daughter had\ndied, and met his wife Morwen there at their grave, just before she,\ntoo, died. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them\nfor the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial\ncaused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Haldad, was slain .\nHúrin met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the\nHaladin, they went to Nargothrond, where Húrin killed the Petty-dwarf\nMîm who had claimed the treasure of Glaurung, earning a curse on the\ngold. Húrin and his outlaws brought the treasure to Doriath, insulting\nThingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Húrin's kin. The\noutlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at\nMenegroth, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the\ngold. Húrin thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading\nto its downfall.\n\nMelian's kind words managed to break through to Húrin's clouded mind,\nand Húrin finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Morgoth. A\nbroken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _HÚRIN_ means “steadfast” and _THALION_ means “hardened.”\nÚMARTH means “ill-fate”.",

    "name": "Aulë",
    "lotr_page_id": "35",
    "text": "AULË (Quenya; IPA: - “Invention”) was an Ainur, one of the Aratar and a\nValar, who was responsible for fashioning and crafting the substances of\nwhich Arda, the world, was composed. He was also called '''Mahal\n'''(Khuzdul; IPA: “Maker”), '''Oli '''(Sindarin; IPA: “Dream”) or\nNÁVATAR and delights in the nature of substances and in works of skill,\nbut not concerned with possession or mastery. Besides the shaping of\nArda, Aulë's greatest works were the Two Lamps of the Valar, the vessels\nof the Sun and Moon, and the Dwarves, whom he created out of impatience\nfor the Children of Ilúvatar. He also created Angainor (the chain of\nMelkor). Biography As Aulë was a smith, he was the Valar most similar in\nthought and powers to Melkor, in that they each gloried in the\nfashioning of artful and original things. Both also came to create\nbeings of their own. But while Aulë strove to be true to the original\nintent of the Music of the Ainurs, and submitted all that he did to the\nwill of Ilúvatar, Melkor wished to control and subvert all things, and\nwas jealous of the creations of others so that he would try to twist or\ndestroy all that they made. There was long strife between Aulë and\nMelkor both before and after the creation of Arda. Aulë, however,\ntraditionally opposed attempts to fight Melkor, for fear of the damage\nthat would be wrought to Arda. When the Elves came to Valinor, the\nÑoldor became the students of Aulë. Fëanor was his greatest pupil, and\nfrom him learned to make gems through craftsmanship that is now\nforgotten. This would eventually lead to the Silmarils, the greatest\ncreation of handiwork within Arda. On the Flight of the Noldor, the\nNoldor who returned to Valinor under Finarfin named themselves the\n_Aulendur_, Followers of Aulë. Despite his lordly skill, Aulë was humble\nand compassionate, and indeed the Dwarves survived only because Aulë\nsubmitted them to the will of Ilúvatar. His spouse was Yavanna, with\nwhom he dwelt in central Valinor. The Creation of the Dwarves Desperate\nfor pupils onto whom he could pass his knowledge, and unwilling to wait\nfor the emergence of the Children of Ilúvatar, Aulë created his own race\nof beings, the dwarves. However, he did not have a clear idea of what\nthe Children of Ilúvatar would be like, and because of the presence of\nthe chaos caused by Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves strong and unyielding,\nand not willing to endure the domination of others, as well as embodying\nsome of his values and desires for Middle-earth. However Aulë did not\nhave the power to give independent life to his creations, they could act\nonly when his thought was on them. When Aulë completed his work he began\nto instruct the Dwarves in a language he had made for them, Khuzdul.\nThen Ilúvatar spoke to Aulë, asking why he would seek to exceed his\npower and authority by attempting to make new life. Aulë repented,\nanswering that the drive to create was kindled in him by Ilúvatar, and\nthat he only wished for other beings to love and teach, with whom to\nshare in the beauty of the world. He admitted that his impatience had\ndriven him to folly and submitted his creations to Ilúvatar. Assuming\nthat they should be destroyed, he made to smite the seven Fathers of the\nDwarves with a great hammer.  As he raised the hammer the Dwarves shrank\nfrom the coming blow, but Ilúvatar stayed Aulë's hand and showed that he\nhad accepted Aulë's offer by gifting the Dwarves with spirits of their\nown, else they could not have been afraid. Ilúvatar accepted the Dwarves\nas his adopted children however, as it was ordained that the elves were\nto be the first-born race, Ilúvatar set the Dwarves to sleep until after\nthe Awakening of the Elves. He told Aulë that while both were his\nchildren, their creation was outside the scope of the Music of the\nAinur, and strife would arise between the Dwarven race and the Elven\nrace as the events of the world unfolded. The Dwarves believe that after\nthey die their spirits move to halls that Aulë has set aside for them\nalone, and that their role will be to rebuild Arda after the Final\nBattle. Maiar of Aulë - Mairon (Sauron), the mightiest of the Maiar of\nAulë who used his knowledge of the metaphysical structure of Arda to\ngreat effect as a servant of Melkor in the First Age of Middle-earth and\nthen was his own master in the Second and Third Ages. When Sauron sought\nto corrupt the elves in the Second Age one of the names he assumed was\nAulendil, meaning devotee of Aulë.   - Curumo (Saruman), the leader of\nthe wizards sent to lead the people of Middle-earth against Sauron, only\nto betray his fellow wizards and ally with Sauron himself (who he also\nbetrayed in the end). It is interesting to note that two of the greatest\nMaiar sent to Middle-earth, that fell, were in the beginning both\naligned with Aulë. The reason for this is probably that this is the\norder most associated with craft, skill, and by these means, power.\nWeaker-willed spirits often fall prey to craving for power in Tolkien's\nworks, and these prove no exception. Also, Tolkien generally sees\nindustry as corruption. It seems Maiar of Aulë are the most powerful\nMaia because they are the closest to Ilúvatar's creation skills. Powers\nAulë seems to have a power most akin to Ilúvatar's - he can create an\ninnumerable amount of things. He made the Two Lamps, and made Angainor,\nMorgoth's chain. Although he does not have access to the Flame\nImperishable, he was able to create life (although it does not have free\nwill). As a Valar, he possesses incredible strength, and has been noted\nto have rebuilt Arda during and after Morgoth's period of destruction\nbefore the coming of the Elves. He likely forged the Valar's weaponry\nand armor for the War of Wrath. His strength is in the construction of\nnew things, and he is as near to the antithesis of the destructive\nMorgoth as one can be.﻿ Etymology _Aulë_ means ''invention ''in Quenya.\n_Mahal_ means ''maker ''in Khuzdul. _Oli_ means _dream_ in Sindarin.",

    "text": "GIMLI, son of Glóin, was a well-respected dwarf warrior in Middle-earth\nduring the Great Years. He was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring,\nand was the only one of the dwarves to readily fight alongside elves in\nthe war against Sauron at the end of the Third Age. After the defeat of\nSauron, he was given lordship of the Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nGimli was the son of Glóin and a nephew of Óin, both former companions\nof Bilbo Baggins. He was a remote descendant of Durin the Deathless,\nfather of the first house of dwarven people. Gimli stemmed from, but was\nnot an inheritor of, the royal line. Through his father, Gimli was also\nthe first cousin once removed (or “nephew”, for simplicity's sake) of\nBalin, Lord of Moria, and his brother Dwalin, two more former companions\nof Bilbo. It is also stated in the _Unfinished Tales_ that Gimli was\nprevented from traveling with his father on The Quest of Erebor because\nThorin and company thought him too young, though Gimli, being in his\nsixties, considered himself ripe for adventure and was disappointed to\nbe left behind.\n\nInvolvement with the Ring\n\n\n\nIn the year 3017 of the Third Age, an emissary from Mordor approached\nthe King under the Mountain, Dáin II, with offers of friendship and\nrequests for news of a Hobbit bearing a Ring. Not trusting the\nmessenger, Dáin sent Glóin and Gimli to Rivendell to seek the advice of\nElrond, and to have Bilbo warned that the Enemy was seeking him. As a\nresult, they were summoned to the Council of Elrond, where Elrond\nbelieved they would find the answers to their questions and would be\nable to contribute. Whilst there, Gloin told Elrond of the messenger and\nmade reference to Balin, who had entered Moria and attempted to reclaim\nit. However, he had not sent any word to King Dáin II for five years,\nand Gloin was concerned. The Council ultimately chose to send Frodo\nBaggins to Mordor to destroy the Ring, and decided that a small\nfellowship should go with him. Gimli volunteered to accompany the\nFellowship to Mordor to destroy the One Ring.\n\n\n\nHe volunteered to join the company at least in part because Legolas had\nvolunteered and he doubted the elf's intentions. Gimli journeyed with\nthe fellowship southward along the Misty Mountains. However, the\nFellowship was stymied in their attempt to traverse the pass of\nCaradhras, and were compelled to travel under the mountain rather than\ngo over it. While none in the Fellowship were particularly keen on\npassing thorough Moria, Gimli at least was eager to learn what may have\nhappened to Balin. Unfortunately, while in Moria, Gimli discovered\nBalin's tomb, as well as evidence that virtually all of the Dwarves who\nhad attempted to retake Moria had been slain years prior. After Gandalf\nfell with Durin's Bane from the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, the Fellowship\nentered the Woods of Lothlórien, thus making Gimli the first dwarf to\nenter the Realm since the Balrog was awakened in Moria. However, there\nwas some tension regarding Gimli's being in the Wood, and his Elven\nescorts wished to blindfold him for the journey. Gimli staunchly refused\nuntil Aragorn decided that all in the Fellowship should be blindfolded\nto make the Elven demand more equitable. While in Lorien, he accompanied\nLegolas on many walks through the wooded city, and the two became fast\nfriends. When the fellowship departed, he was given a strand of\nGaladriel's hair, though when he asked for one, he was given three,\nwhich would lead to his name in later years of “Lockbearer”, given to\nhim by Galadriel. When the Fellowship of the Ring fractured, Gimli\naccompanied Aragorn and Legolas in pursuit of Meriadoc Brandybuck and\nPeregrin Took, who had been captured by the forces of Isengard.\n\n\n\nEventually the three were reunited with Gandalf, and became more\ninvolved with the war. Gimli played a critical role in the defeat of the\nforces of Isengard at Helms Deep, where he was separated from Aragorn\nand Legolas and driven into the caves which he would later become Lord\nof. He fought his way out alongside Eomer when the forces of Isengard\nwere driven from Helm's Deep. His skill with an axe led to his winning,\nby one orc, the friendly contest he and Legolas held over who could kill\nthe most Orcs, despite starting with a disadvantage. Gimli then\naccompanied Aragorn and Legolas through the Dimholt in an attempt to\nrecruit the Army of the Dead. Upon freeing Gondor’s soldiers and\ncapturing the Corsair's ships, the forces under Aragorn, including\nGimli, sailed to Minas Tirith. After being victorious at the Battle of\nthe Pelennor Fields, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and the remainder of the\nGondor and Rohan armies to the Black gates.\n\nLife after the War\n\n\n\nAfter the War, Gimli led a large number of Durin's Folk south to\nestablish a new Dwarf kingdom in the Glittering Caves, which were\nlocated behind Helm's Deep where Gimli was trapped during the battle,\nand he became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves. The Dwarves of the\nGlittering Caves, led by their Lord Gimli, would repair much of the\nphysical damage that was incurred during the War of the Ring. Most\nnotably, they rebuilt the Great Gate of Minas Tirith with a new one made\nof Mithril and steel, as well as improving upon the existing layout of\nthe entire city.\n\nGimli was 139 years old (born in 2879 of the Third Age) when the\nFellowship of the Ring set out from Rivendell, making him 52 years older\nthan Aragorn. His date of death is not known, and according to the _Red\nBook of Westmarch_, he is said to have traveled with Legolas into the\nWest, thus becoming the first dwarf to visit the Undying Lands. Of this\npossibility, Tolkien wrote that it would be strange indeed, that any\nDwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the\nEldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit\nit, but that it is said that Gimli went not only because of his great\nfriendship with Legolas, but also out of desire to see again the beauty\nof Galadriel; and that she, being mighty among the Eldar, may have\nobtained this grace for him.",

    "text": "BOROMIR was a valiant warrior known in Gondor for his greatness, having\nalready achieved great merit in Gondor prior to the Council of Elrond.\nHe is the eldest son of Denethor II, who was Steward of Gondor during\nthe War of the Ring, and his wife Finduilas. Even the people of Rohan\nadmired him, particularly Éomer. He is the older brother of Faramir.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBefore the War of the Ring\n\n\n\nBoromir was born in the year TA 2978. He was the eldest child of\nDenethor II (the penultimate Steward of Gondor) and his wife Finduilas,\nand would have taken over as Steward after Denethor's death, had he\nlived. When Boromir was only ten years old, his mother died.\nConsequently, his father became a grim person and visibly preferred\nBoromir over his brother, Faramir. Despite this fact, Boromir looked\nafter his younger brother and they became very close. Boromir devoted\nhimself to leading his people and fought in the battle for the eastern\npart of Osgiliath. He, his brother, and two others were the only\nsurvivors of the unit that held the bridge until its destruction; they\nhad to swim the river Anduin to reach safety.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nBoromir, by order of his father, Denethor, set out from Minas Tirith to\nRivendell to decipher a riddle that was given to him and his brother in\ntheir dreams:\n\n    _Seek for the Sword that was broken,_\n    _In Imladris it dwells,_\n    _There shall be counsels taken,_\n    _Stronger than Morgul-spells._\n    _There shall be shown a token,_\n    _That Doom is near at hand,_\n    _For Isildur's Bane shall waken,_\n    _And the Halfling forth shall stand._\n\nBoromir lost his horse in Tharbad and travelled the rest of the way on\nfoot. The journey took 110 days. He arrived at the beginning of the\nCouncil of Elrond where he talked about how Gondor was defending itself\nfrom Mordor and tried to convince them to give the One Ring to Gondor\nwhere he felt it would be kept safe. But the council disagreed with the\nOne Ring's being taken to Gondor, deciding that the only safe course was\nto destroy it.\n\nBoromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring and was warned by Elrond to\nnot blow the Horn of Gondor until they were close to Gondor and in dire\nneed. He proved his worth as a capable warrior in the Mines of Moria,\nand assisted Aragorn in fighting off a large number of orcs and goblins.\nAfter the loss of Gandalf and the Fellowship's departure of Moria,\nBoromir expressed opposition to Aragorns decision to continue to Lorien,\nargueing that to go south was better. He believed that stories told in\nGondor of the Galadriel's magic would harm them. He eventually agreed to\ngo after Aragorn assured him the elves would help them. In Lothlórien,\nBoromir was disturbed by what he felt was Galadriel's testing of his\nmind, and he was suspicious of her motives. Before leaving Lothlórien\nhe was given the gift of an elven-cloak and a golden belt.\n\nBoromir disliked the idea of destroying the One Ring, as he believed\nthat it could be used to defeat Sauron once and for all, to save Gondor,\nand return it to its former glory; he tried to convince Frodo to give\nhim the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir tried to take it by force but\nthe hobbit put it on and fled.\n\nAfter Boromir realized his actions were caused by the corruption of the\nOne Ring, he repented, and upon returning to camp he was confronted by\nAragorn about Frodo. Boromir told Aragorn that he had seen Frodo an hour\nago where he had tried to convince Frodo to bring the One Ring to Minas\nTirith. They then had an argument and Frodo walked off. After the\nargument Boromir went for a walk, until eventually returning to the\ncamp. The Fellowship, especially Aragorn, believed that there was more\nto the confrontation than Boromir was telling them, but Aragorn did not\npress the issue. Upon hearing of Frodo's predicament, the rest of the\nFellowship, particularly the Hobbits, scattered in an ill-concieved\nattempt to find him. Aragorn ordered Boromir to follow and look after\nMerry and Pippin while he took off after Sam.\n\nDuring the search, Merry and Pippin ran into a group of Uruk-Hai,\nwho tried to capture them. Boromir came to their aid and drove the orcs\noff, but more orcs came and Boromir was mortally wounded by many arrows.\nAragorn found him dying under a tree, with Merry and Pippin gone. He\nstayed with Boromir until he died from his wounds.\n\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli laid his body inside one of the boats of\nLórien, and sent him down the Falls of Rauros. Afterwards, they sang the\nLament for Boromir.\n\nLegacy\n\n\n\nThree days after Boromir's death, his brother Faramir saw his funeral\nboat passing down the Anduin. Men of Gondor found Boromir's horn, the\nHorn of Gondor, broken in twain, and brought it to his father. This\ndrove Denethor to despair, and when compounded with Faramir's later\nseemingly-mortal wounding and his knowledge of Mordor's indomitable\nmight, he lost his mind. Many, including Faramir, often lamented\nBoromir's passing as Sauron readied his forces to attack, noting that\nhis loss would be keenly felt by Gondor on the field of battle.\n\nBoromir won respect even from his enemies: in _The Two Towers_, Ugluk\nboasts that it was the Uruk-hai who “slew the mighty warrior,” a clear\nreference to Boromir.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nBoromir was above all else exceedingly valiant and steadfast, and was\nheld in great esteem by the fighting men of many nations. He was noted\nas being somewhat dissimilar in manner and thought from both his father,\nDenethor, and his brother Faramir, but he loved them both greatly. He\nwas selfless and bold, but he took little interest in the books and\nscrolls that his brother so often read, having little interest in lore.\nIt was said of him by Éomer that he had a great deal in common with the\npeople of Rohan. However, his desire to protect his people, and his\ninability to do so, left him vulnerable to the predations of the One\nRing. This eventually caused him to attempt to take it from Frodo,\nthough he deeply regretted this almost immediately after it occurred. At\none point, when envisioning he would have hoped to achieve if he took\nthe One Ring and overthrew Sauron, his world after Sauron's defeat was\none of peace and security, where he used the Ring to rule with wisdom\nand generosity.",

    "lotr_page_id": "717",
    "text": "“DURIN'S BANE” refers to the particular BALROG of Morgoth that had fled\nfollowing Morgoth's defeat during the War of Wrath to live and slumber\ndeep within the depths of the Dwarven kingdom of Moria.\n\nAlthough its true name and history are largely unknown, this Balrog\nbecame an important figure during the War of the Ring, eventually being\nawakened by the Dwarves of Moria, wreaking destruction upon them. Moria\nbecame left to the Balrog, and became known as a place of darkness and\nfear for hundreds of years, and it was not until the Fellowship of the\nRing had passed through Moria and inadvertently awakened the Balrog that\nit was finally slain in a great duel with the wizard Gandalf.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nDurin's Bane was one of the Maiar spirits that existed before The\nCreation of the world (of the same race as Gandalf and Saruman), who\ndescended into Arda with the Valar. It was eventually seduced and\ncorrupted by Melkor, becoming one of the Valaraukar and joining with the\nother balrogs in Morgoth's service. The balrog fought in many battles of\nthe War of the Jewels, up to and including the War of Wrath. It somehow\nmanaged to survive Morgoth's defeat, fleeing east and taking refuge\nbeneath the Misty Mountains.\n\nFor more than five thousand years, the balrog lay dormant at the roots\nof the mountain Barazinbar beneath the dwarf kingdom of Khazad-dûm. It\nremained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third\nAge, until the miners of Dwarf-King Durin VI awoke it when they mined\ntoo deeply and too greedily in their search for mithril. The balrog slew\nDurin, and was thereafter known as Durin's Bane.\n\n\n\nThe dwarves attempted to fight the balrog, but its power was far too\ngreat. Despite their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, King Náin\nand many of the dwarves were killed, and the survivors were forced to\nflee. News of the disaster reached the Silvan Elves of Lothlórien, who\ncalled the balrog the _Nameless Terror_ (not knowing its true nature at\nthe time) and began to refer to Khazad-dûm as _Moria_ (dark abyss).\n\nFor five hundred years, Moria was left to the balrog. Sauron began to\nput his plans for war into effect around the year TA 2480 of the Third\nAge, and sent orcs and trolls to the Misty Mountains to bar all of the\npasses. Some of these creatures came to Moria, where they stayed in\nuneasy alliance with the balrog, whom they feared.\n\nTolkien did not clarify whether Sauron was aware of the balrog's\npresence prior to this time, and thus the full extent of their alliance\nremains unclear.\n\nThe Balrog had a small but important role at the Battle of\nAzanulbizar, the climactic battle in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In\nTA 2799, the dwarves finally defeated the majority of the orcs occupying\nMoria, but Dáin II Ironfoot, having slain the orc Azog, felt the terror\nof the Balrog at the gate and declared that Moria itself remained beyond\ntheir power to conquer. Despite an attempt to recolonize Moria by Balin\nin TA 2989, Durin's Bane remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the\nDwarves, its true nature hidden to the outside world.\n\n\n\nIn January of TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring traveled through Moria\non their way to Mordor. There, they were attacked in the Chamber of\nMazarbul by orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when\nGandalf, who was also a Maia, tried to place a “shutting spell” on the\ndoor to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on\nthe other side and cast a counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of command\nto stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed. The\ncompany fled with Gandalf, but the orcs and the balrog, taking a\ndifferent route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. At the\nBridge, Legolas instantly recognized it as a Balrog, and Gimli\nrecognized it as Durin's Bane. Gandalf then challenged it in order to\nallow the others to escape.\n\nThe balrog ignited its whole body in flames, then attacked with its\nflaming sword, which melted into red-hot liquid metal when it met\nGandalf's own sword, Glamdring. The Balrog ignited its body a second\ntime, then took out its red-hot whip and swung it about. Gandalf then\nsmote the Bridge before him with his staff. The staff broke asunder, a\nblinding sheet of white flame springing up, and the bridge cracked at\nthe feet of the Balrog, who fell forward into the abyss. But as the\nBalrog fell, it swung its whip upwards. The thongs of the whip wrapped\naround Gandalf's legs, dragging him over the edge and into the darkness\nbelow with the Balrog.\n\n\n\nAfter a long fall, the two crashed into a great subterranean lake, which\nGandalf later said was as cold as the tide of death and almost froze his\nheart. The water quenched the Balrog's fire, reducing it to “a thing of\nslime, stronger than a strangling snake”. Despite this relatively weak\nstate, Durin's Bane renewed its attack on the wizard, and the two fought\nin the water, with the Balrog clutching at Gandalf to strangle him, and\nGandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled\ninto ancient tunnels of unknown origin. There, Gandalf pursued the\ncreature out of the tunnels, back into Moria and up the Endless Stair.\nThe chase ended atop the peak of Zirakzigil, or Celebdil, when the\nBalrog's bodily flames were renewed, restoring much of its power. There,\nbeginning on the 23rd of Solmath, the pair of Maiar fought what was\nlater known as the Battle of the Peak. After a climactic battle that\nspanned for an increasingly broad amount of days, Gandalf prevailed and\nfinally slew the Balrog, casting it down from the peak and sending it\ncrashing onto the mountain side. The wounded and exhausted Gandalf died\nshortly afterwards, but was eventually “sent back, for a brief time,\nuntil his task was finished”. The great eagle Gwaihir the Windlord (lord\nof the Great Eagles of Middle-earth) found him and carried him to\nLothlórien where he was healed and clothed in white – he had become\nGandalf the White.\n\nThe ultimate fate of Durin's Bane is not known, as only its physical\nform died, as with all Maiar when they were “killed,” but what happened\nto the spirit of the balrog was not revealed. It is also unknown if it\nwas the last of its kind, or if there were other Balrogs who managed to\nescape the War of Wrath and remained hidden in long forgotten\nplaces.",

    "text": "ELU THINGOL was an Elf of the Teleri during the First Age. His brother\nwas Olwë, who became the Lord of Alqualondë, Lord of Tol Eressëa, and\nHigh King of the Teleri of Aman, both of whom may have had a second\nbrother called Elmo. He was a good friend of Finwë, the first High King\nof the Ñoldor during the times before the elves reached Aman.\n\nHe was the founder and first King of the northern Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and was respected by all the Sindar of the Beleriand, who\nconsidered him to be the High King of the Sindar and the Lord of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nBiography\n\nSundering of the Elves\n\n\n\nElwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed\nparents. He first appears in the history of the Eldar when he travels\nfrom Cuiviénen with Oromë as ambassador of the Teleri to see the land of\nValinor. Interestingly, since Thingol had previously visited Valinor as\nan ambassador of the Teleri, he is debateably both of the Sindar and of\nthe Calaquendi. Upon his return, he manages to convince many of his\npeople to follow him back to that country. On the Great Journey to the\nWest, the Teleri lag behind, and do not arrive at the coast until after\nthe departure of the moving island of Tol Eressëa. Thus, they stay in\nBeleriand for many years until Tol Eressëa is brought again to fetch\nthem. By this time, many of the Teleri have grown to like Beleriand, and\ndecide to stay there. Elwë is among them, having encountered Melian the\nMaia in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her.\nAfterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to\nlinger in Middle-earth or stay there until he could be found.\n\n\n\nRule of Doriath\n\nFor centuries Elwë remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord\nand many of his people joined him in the great forested area of the\nBeleriand. Now known as Thingol, he and Melian become king and queen of\nthe Teleri who stay in Beleriand, who then become known as the Sindar.\nHe founded a realm in a large forested area in the Beleriand first known\nas Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the\nstars, Thingol and Melian have a daughter named Lúthien, who is said to\nbe the fairest woman ever to have lived.\n\nAs Lord of Beleriand, he welcomed his long lost kin now known as the\nLaiquendi or Green-elves vast lands in Ossiriand which they would name\nLindon. He was also the first elf to make contact and alliances with the\nDwarves of Belegost who helped delve the caves of the great\nFortress/City of Menegroth which became the capital of Thingol's\nkingdom. When the Dwarves first became aware of unknown but savage\ncreatures coming from out of the North, Thingol was the first to know\nabout it and not having any heavy weapons of war he once again asked the\nDwarves for their aid. They forged for him weapons and armour he needed\nto fight them.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\nWhen Melkor returned to Middle-earth, he sought once again to master\nMiddle-earth and its peoples and declared war on them. He sent his great\nhosts of Orcs into the Beleriand starting what became known as the First\nBattle of Beleriand. Thingol led his people to victory against the Orcs\nsuccessfully driving them out of his kingdom and most of the Beleriand.\nAfterwards, Melian set the Girdle around his kingdom which would be\nknown from then on as Doriath which no one could enter without his\npermission. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he gave them leave\nto dwell in the north part and dealt only with the House of Finarfin as\nthey were kin through his brother Olwë. When he learned of the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with\nmost of the Ñoldor and their war and even outlawed the use of Quenya in\nhis kingdom.\n\nThingol was drawn into the war with Morgoth and the deadly Oath of\nFëanor when after the Dagor Bragollach, Lúthien fell in love with a man\nnamed Beren. Thingol did not wish for the two to be wedded to each\nother, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of\nMen. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth,\nthinking there was no way that Beren could fulfill this demand. Thus,\nThingol was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately\nthe doom of Fëanor.\n\nDeath\n\nIt was, however, this very bride-price that doomed him. After Húrin\nbrought the treasures of Nargothrond to Doriath, Thingol summoned\nDwarves of Belegost to Menegroth and invited them to work the treasure\ninto jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.\n\nThe Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above\nall but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost\nfinished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves\nof Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the\nSilmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\n\nEnthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the Dwarves\ndemanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them.\nThingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an\nimpertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves attempted to slay him.\nAfter a long battle between Dwarves and elves inside the city, Dwarves\nwere driven out of the city, two escaped to Nogrod and persuaded the\ncity to march on Doriath. They escaped and told a much different story\nto their home cities and got them to march on and sack Doriath. Later\nwith the help of certain treacherous elves also possessed of the cursed\ntreasure they regained entrance past the Girdle. Thingol was lured out\non a hunt with but a small company of arms, where he was ambushed by\nwaiting Dwarves, and was slain. The fortress of the Thousand Caves was\ntaken at unawares and plundered. They could not seize nor harm Melian,\nand she left to seek Beren and Lúthien.\n\nThingol's heir was Dior Eluchil, the son of Beren and Lúthien.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ELU THINGOL_ derives from the Sindarin _Elu Sindacollo_, meaning “Elu\nGreycloak”, from _thind_ or _sinda_ (“grey”) and _collo_ (“cloak”).\n\nThe original form of his name was _ELWË SINGOLLO_ from the Quenya _el_\n(“star”) and _wë_ (“person”).\n\n\nWeapons\n\nThingol's sword was called ARANRÚTH (“King's Ire”) which later became\nthe sword of the Númenórean kings. He also owned Anglachel, the sword\nforged by Eöl who gave it to him as payment for dwelling in Nan Elmoth\nalone.",

    "text": "TUOR was an Adan of the House of Hador and great hero of Men, the only\nson of Huor and Rían. He was the cousin of Túrin Turambar.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nTuor was born in FA 472 after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in which his father\nHuor died. After hearing that the battle was lost, Rían fell into\ndespair and left Dor-lómin while still pregnant with Tuor. She would\nhave been lost and died if not for the Sindar Elves of Mithrim who\nrescued her and took her to their home in the Mountains of Mithrim. Tuor\nwas soon born and first fostered by the Grey-elves. Later, their leader\nAnnael told his mother Rían that Huor had perished in the battle. She\nsoon fell into grief in her early twenties and went to Haudh-En-Ndengin,\nthe Hill of the Slain and seeing the mounds of rotting and despoiled\nremains, she fell sick and died.\n\nWhen the Easterlings came to claim their reward for aiding Morgoth in\nthe Nirnaeth Arnoediad, they occupied Hithlum and captured its people as\ntheir slaves. The Sindar moved their camp into the caves of Androth and\nit was there that Tuor spent his youth. In his sixteenth year, he grew\nangry with the Easterlings and their allies for the evil deeds they had\ndone to his people and wished to fight them. Annael forbid this and Tuor\nobeyed. When the Elven group intended to move to the safer havens in the\nMouths of Sirion through the Gate of the Noldor, Tuor went with them but\nthe group came under attack by Orcs and scattered during the night. Tuor\nwas captured and sent to the Easterlings and sold into slavery.\n\nA Thrall in Hithlum\n\nTuor served the Easterling chief, the brutal Lorgan, who had been sent\nthere by Morgoth and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the House of\nHador. He worked as a thrall for three years, at which point he had\ngrown to his full stature, and became taller and swifter than any of the\nEasterlings.\n\nA Wandering Outlaw\n\n\n\nTuor then escaped, and lived the life of an outlaw. He travelled down\nHithlum to the Cirith Ninniach, and then through the Gate of the Noldor\ninto Nevrast. At the Gate of the Ñoldor, he met two Noldorin Elves,\nGelmir and Arminas, who showed him the way into Nevrast. He spent the\nrest of the year in Nevrast, until he saw seven swans, and took it as a\nsign that he had tarried too long. He followed these swans down the\ncoast until he reached the ruins of Vinyamar, the previous home of\nTurgon and his people.\n\nAt this point, the Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, emerged from the Belegaer\nand appeared to Tuor, bestowing upon him a great cloak to shield him\nfrom the eyes of his enemies, and a quest to remind Turgon of the Doom\nof the Ñoldor, and to warn him of the Fall of Gondolin. He also found\nVoronwë, an Elf of Gondolin, who had been a mariner on the last Noldorin\nvoyage to Valinor, saved from the wrath of Ossë.\n\nTuor and Voronwë then travelled through the Fell Winter past the Pools\nof Ivrin, where they caught a glimpse of Tuor's cousin, Turin, wielding\nGurthang, and making his way towards the wastes of Dor-lomin.\n\nLife in Gondolin\n\n\n\nPassing through the Fell Winter, Tuor and Voronwë eventually arrived in\nGondolin in FA 496. Upon arriving, he proclaimed to have been sent from\nUlmo with a message to Turgon. Seeing Tuor arrayed in the devices of\nUlmo, he was immediately taken to see the king, where he delivered\nUlmo's warning to depart; that Morgoth was coming ever closer to\ndiscovering the location of Gondolin. However, Maeglin argued against\nTuor and Turgon became conflicted. For he had grown to greatly love his\ncity, which was by now as fair as Tirion itself, and he trusted still in\nit's secrecy and strength. As such, he did not evacuate as Ulmo advised.\nHowever, he did not wholly disregard the wisdom of Ulmo, and decreed\nthat none should ever pass out of the Hidden City again. He ordered the\npassage through the Encircling Mountains to be sealed up, and as such\nTuor was forced to remain in Gondolin, though he did so gladly. Tuor\nrose quickly in honor in the city, being of great stature both\nphysically and spiritually and having had the privilege of conversing\ndirectly with Ulmo. Seven years after arriving in Gondolin, Tuor fell in\nlove with King Turgon's Elven daughter, Idril Celebrindal, who loved him\nin return. Turgon, who already considered Tuor as close as kin, gave the\ncouple his blessing. They were wed in a celebration of great happiness,\nand soon after, their only child Eärendil the Mariner was born, who\nhimself became the father of Elrond and Elros.\n\nIn the _Book of Lost Tales_, Part 2 (_The History of Middle-earth_, Vol.\n2), the Elves in Gondolin treated Tuor very highly - “Upon a time the\nking caused his most cunning artificers to fashion a suit of armour for\nTuor as a great gift, and it was made of Ñoldorin steel overlaid with\nsilver, but his helm was adorned with a device of metal and jewels like\ntwo swan-wings, one on either side, and a swan's wing was wrought on his\nshield”. “A house was built for him upon the southern walls, for he\nloved the free airs and liked not the close neigbourhood of other\ndwellings. There it was his delight often to stand on the battlements at\ndawn, and folk rejoiced to see the new light catch the wings of his\nhelm.”\n\n\n\nTuor was one of the leaders of Gondolin during the Fall of Gondolin, and\nfought for the city during the attack by the forces of Morgoth. He\nachieved meritorious deeds including forcing the the great Urulókë to\nretreat. He also stopped attack on his wife and son by Maeglin, which he\nwas able to thwart by throwing him from the walls into a fire.\nAfterwards he, his wife, their son Eärendil, and a remnant of Gondolin's\npeople escaped through a secret way in the mountains and traveled to the\nMouths of Sirion. Longing for the sea, Tuor eventually built the ship\nEärrámë and sailed into the West with Idril.\n\nFaithful hero and Elf-friend he may have been, but he was still a Man\nand therefore mortal. However, the tradition of the Ñoldor was that when\nTuor arrived with Idril in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar, he\nbecame the only Man to be accepted as one of the elder kindred, and thus\nshared with Beren and Lúthien, who were also granted a second life in\nMiddle-earth, the exceptional fate of an immortal life in Valinor as\nlong as Arda endured. Whether Eärendil ever found or saw his parents\nagain is not known.\n\nIn _The History of Middle-earth_ series story, Tuor and Idril reached\nthe Tower of Pearl on one of the Enchanted Isles in the Shadowy Seas and\neither one or both fell asleep there for an unknown period of\ntime.",

    "text": "ECTHELION, or ECTHELION OF THE FOUNTAIN, was a mighty lord of Gondolin\nduring the First Age of Middle-earth, and one of its greatest heroes.\nBiography Early life Most of Ecthelion's early life is unknown but he\nmight have lived in Aman in Tirion and might have been one of the\nfollowers of Fingolfin.He passed through the dangerous Helcaraxe and\nlived. After he survived the grinding ice, he settled in Vinyamar in\nNevrast before moving to Gondolin in FA 116. He later became lord of the\nhouse of the fountain. Aredhel's Escort Two hundred years after Gondolin\nwas wrought, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and Egalmoth, along with the White\nLady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City due to Aredhel's yearning for\nthe freedom she once had in Valinor. Their orders were to lead her\ntowards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder brother Fingon. When\ncoming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered them to turn south,\nfor she desired to see the Sons of Fëanor. Thus, Ecthelion and his\ncompanions sought admittance to Doriath, but the wardens refused them\nentrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no other choice, they took\nthe dangerous road between the haunted valleys of Ered Gorgoroth. Near\nNan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, the riders were caught in\na mesh of shadows and they were lost from Aredhel. In vain, they sought\nher afterwards, but the fell offspring of Ungoliant that dwelt in that\nplace pursued them. Barely escaping alive, the three lords returned to\nGondolin without the princess, where they were received in sorrow. A\nLord of Gondolin In the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon\nin the battle Nirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces.\nUpon the defeat of the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.\nTwenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of\nGondolin traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil\nthrough the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the\nGreat Gate. Ecthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor\nmade a reference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion\neventually allowed him entry. He was the leader of the House of the\nFountain, one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim. His people were\nfond of diamonds and silver, their array was most beautiful to the\nsight. In FA 510 during the Fall of Gondolin, Ecthelion led his house\ninto battle accompanied by the music of their flutes and great were the\ndamages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords. Warcry of the\nEldar In the battle over Gondolin, Ecthelion and his forces made their\nentrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in\nreserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the\nswords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror\namong the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by\nside with Tuor and his House of the Wing, they drove away the orcs until\nalmost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Morgoth's army,\nEcthelion killed three Balrogs and his sword did “hurt to their fire”.\nOutnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm\nwas wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they\njoined the remaining leaders in the Square of the King. In that place,\nthe great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion regained his strength\nby drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the enemy's forces towards\nthe Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began retreat. All but\nEcthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand, which was\nremembered as the most valiant “in all the songs or in any tale”. It was\nthere that he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. Bane of Gothmog Tuor tried\nto stand in the way of Gothmog, but he was thrown aside. Then Ecthelion,\nfairest of the Ñoldor, but whose face now had the pallor of grey steel,\ndueled him. Losing his sword due to a wound received he was unable to\nprotect himself. Just as Gothmog was about to deliver the finishing\nblow, Ecthelion jumped and wrapped his legs around the demon, driving\nthe spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. This caused Gothmog to lose\nhis balance, and he, along with Ecthelion, fell into the Fountain of the\nKing. Gothmog's fire was thus quenched, but Ecthelion also drowned with\nhim and found his death in cool waters, whose lord he was. Later, a\nyoung Eärendil asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion were\nthere, “to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles!\nPerchance has he gone on ahead?” After he was informed of Ecthelion's\ndeath, he “wept bitterly” and said that he cared no more to see the\nstreets of Gondolin. Weapons Although it was never confirmed, it is\nlargely believed that Ecthelion is the original owner of Orcrist. If so,\nit is interesting due to the fact that Orcrist and its mate Glamdring\nkilled the two most famous Balrogs of all time - Glamdring later killing\nDurin's Bane, and Orcrist Gothmog. If this is true, then it is also\ncurious that all combatants died during the Balrog battle. Etymology\nThere are three different sources that offer a translation of ECTHELION\nand they all differ substantially. - In _The Book of Lost Tales 2_\nAppendix, it is said that the name derives from the Quenya _ehtelë_\n(“issue of water, spring”), a reference to his title as Lord for the\nHouse of the Fountain. - In the etymologies of _The Lost Road and Other\nWritings_, his name is composed from _ehtë_, (“spear”) and _thela_,\n(“point”) (of spear). Put together they would translate as “Spear-point”\nor “Spear-head”. - In _The War of the Jewels_, which seems to be the\nlast matter J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on it, the name is derived from _aeg_,\n(“sharp”) and _thel_, (“intent, resolve”). This would translate “one of\nsharp resolve”. Other versions of the legendarium Perhaps the earliest\nJ.R.R. Tolkien writing, _The Fall of Gondolin_ was written during a\nleave of absence from the World War I, in the year 1916. It is in that\nstory, published posthumously by Christopher Tolkien in the volume _The\nBook of Lost Tales 2_ that Ecthelion first appears. Thus, he is one of\nthe first characters Tolkien ever created. However, from a chronological\npoint of view, the first account of his presence is the chapter _Of\nMaeglin_ from _The Silmarillion_. The events described here took place\nmore than one hundred and fifty years before those of Gondolin's fall.\nAlong with Glorfindel of Gondolin and Egalmoth, he was assigned by\nTurgon as Aredhel's escort on her ill-fated journey. Though no name is\nmentioned, only that “Turgon appointed three lords of his household”, an\nexplanatory note in the volume _The War of the Jewels_, chapter called\nMaeglin, sheds light on the escorts' identities.

    "text": "BEREN, also called BEREN ERCHAMION, was a man of Middle-earth, and a\nhero whose romance with the Elf Lúthien was one of the great stories of\nthe Elder Days that were told for many ages after he lived.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nEarly life in Dorthonion\n\nBeren was an Edain (a man), the son of Barahir and Emeldir the\nman-hearted. He was a man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion, and\nthe most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle\nof the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin\nof his kingdom. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal\nfollowers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them\nperformed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the\nDark King of Angband. After the ruin of the Outlaws of Dorthonion and\nthe death of his father, Beren lived alone in Dorthonion off the land\nand came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they\nhelped him when he needed it. During this time, he hunted nothing and\nate no meat and only killed the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the\ncountry. He learned not to fear death only captivity and bondage;\nhowever, things began to grow more difficult for him in Dorthonion for\nMorgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the\nland of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He crossed into Doriath,\nthrough the forests of Dungortheb, where he saw and fell in love with\nLúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\n Thingol\nhaughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He said that he\nwould allow the marriage to take place only if Beren brought back a\nSilmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be\nimpossible, but Beren and Lúthien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond\nand Huan the Great Hound (both of whom died protecting Beren), braved\nmany perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful\nlieutenant) and captured a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from\nAngband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred,\nawoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert\nthe beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand swallowed it\nand the Silmaril (thus Beren was called ERCHAMION, One-hand), and\nproceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Lúthien and the unconscious\nBeren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë. When he presented himself to\nThingol, he demonstrated to him that he had obtained, then lost the\nSilmaril at the cost of one of his hands; he was then given the name\nCAMLOST, Empty-handed. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth,\nwhere the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was\naccomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.\n\nSecond life\n\n\n\nLúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death,\nshe lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she\nmanaged to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren\nwere miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as\nmortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a\nplace unknown. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol\nGalen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed\napart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the\nFirst Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of dwarves who\nhad destroyed Doriath and stolen the Nauglamír (and the Silmaril with\nit).\n\nLúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be\none of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of\nmen, of elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of\nBeren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.\n\nLegacy\n\nBeren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite\nthemselves into a greater force to vanquish his power resulting in the\nvaliant but doomed Union of Maedhros. His romance and love for\nLúthien Tinúviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped\nfoster greater respect for men amongst the elves. He was also the first\nto mix the blood of elves and men with each other and this bloodline\ncontinued, siring the Númenórean nobility and the Dúnedain alike on\nup to Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Noldorin, the name _BEREN_ means “Bold”.\n\nHis epithets, _Erchamion_ (“one-handed”) and _Camlost_ (“empty-handed”),\nboth contain the Sindarin word _cam_ (“hand”).\n\n\nWeapons\n\nAs an outlaw in Dorthonion, Beren used Dagmor and a bow to aid him in\nhis journey. Later, he carried a knife called Angrist, which he used\nto cut the Silmaril from the Crown of Morgoth.\n\n\nInspiration and evolution of character\n\nThe story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in _The\nLord of the Rings_, was a central part of the legendarium. Tolkien once\nreferred to it as “the kernel of the mythology” . He went on to say\nthat it \"arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks', which\nhe visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during World\nWar I).\n\nTyr, a god of Norse Mythology, was a possible literary inspiration for\nBeren's loss of his hand to the wolf.\n\nWhen Tolkien died in 1973, he was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North\nOxford). The inscription on his gravestone reads:\n\n    JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 - 1973\n\nThe name of _Lúthien_ also appears on the stone of his wife Edith:\n\n    EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the earliest version of the legendarium, Beren was going to be human,\nbut Tolkien erased over the original versions and wrote over much of the\ntext. The details of the original version of the story are little\nknown.\n\nIn the written draft, and published version Beren was changed to a GNOME\n(a Ñoldorin Elf), son of Egnor (which might have been an early name for\nAegnor). According to _Beren and Lúthien_ Egnor and Egnor (Aegnor)\nare two separate persons. It treats Barahir and Egnor bo-Rimion as two\nseparate persons (there is no explanation given, other than his father\nchanged concepts of Beren's race over time). But due to Christopher's\nplan to avoid too much editorial influence, he doesn't 'fix' or edit\nBeren's race to be consistent between different chapters of the story,\nbut retains whatever race his father had used at the time of wring each\nsection of the story for what he considers the 'continuous and\nstandalone story' derived from all the sources.\n\nSome of the artwork included in the book (all of which is drawn by Alan\nLee) seems to reflect Beren's interchanging Elven ancestry - in\nparticular the cover artwork, which appears to portray a scene from The\nTale of Tinúviel with Beren, Lúthien, and Huan.",

    "lotr_page_id": "309",
    "text": "EÄRENDIL (Quenya; IPA: ) was one of the most important figures in J.R.R.\nTolkien's Middle-earth mythology: a great Half-elven mariner who voyaged\nto Valinor and carried a star across the sky. His story is found in _The\nSilmarillion_, and there are several references to him throughout _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nHe is the father of Elros, the first King of Númenor, and of Elrond, the\nLord of Rivendell and an important figure in Middle-earth during the\nSecond and Third age.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEärendil was the Half-elven son of Tuor and Princess Idril daughter of\nTurgon. He was born in FA 503 and was raised in Gondolin. When he was\nseven years old, he and his parents escaped the sacking of Gondolin,\nliving afterwards in Arvernien by the mouth of Sirion. The\nsurvivors of Gondolin and Doriath mingled at the Havens of Sirion. In FA\n530, Eärendil wedded Elwing daughter of King Dior Eluchil. Two years\nlater, Elros and Elrond were born to them, and Eärendil began his voyage\nin search for Tuor and Idril, who had departed earlier over the Sea.\nWith the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship,\nVingilótë.\n\n\n\nAt this time, Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had\nwrested from Morgoth. News of this came to the sons of Fëanor that were\nstill living, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, and slew\nmost of them. Círdan and Gil-Galad sent ships to help them but were too\nlate. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself with the\nSilmaril into the sea, leaving her young sons behind.\n\nHearing of the tragedy that had befallen Arvernien, Eärendil then sought\nafter Valinor, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil\nthus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil\nthen went before the Valar, and asked them for aid for Men and Elves in\nMiddle-earth, to fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his\nplea.\n\n\n\nBecause Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves,\nand not for his own sake, Manwë forbore to deal out the punishment of\ndeath that was due; and because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended\nfrom a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the\ngift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was\nfurther passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the\nHalf-elven). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have\nrather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose\nto be one of the Elves.\n\nThe Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host\nto Middle-earth, and overthrew Morgoth, and bound him. Eärendil took\npart in the battle, riding on Vingilot beside Thorondor and the Eagles.\nIt was his blow that slew the great dragon Ancalagon and cast it down\nonto Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation\ncaused by the War of Wrath, led to the Ruin of Beleriand. Eärendil's\nfate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that\nBeren and Luthien had wrested from Morgoth and guard the Sun and Moon.\n\nIn the Second Prophecy of Mandos, it is told that Eärendil will return\nfrom the sky for the love of the Sun and Moon that Melkor would blot\nout, and fight in the Dagor Dagorath.\n\n\nLater mentions\n\nThe Hobbit of the Shire, Bilbo Baggins, wrote a Song of Eärendil which\nwas sung in Rivendell, the house of Eärendil's son, Elrond.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n His father-name _EÄRENDIL_ is a\nQuenya name which means “Lover of the Sea”, from _eä_ (“sea”) and the\nsuffix _-ndil_ (“devoted to, friend, lover”). His mother-name is\nARDAMÍRË “Arda-jewel”, from the Quenya term _mírë_ (“jewel”).\n\nThe first rendering of his name, before the making of his final tale in\n_The Silmarillion_, was EÄRENDEL.\n\nThe Adûnaic translation of Eärendil is AZRUBÊL.\n\nEpithets\n\nEärendil was given many epithets: Eärendil Halfelven, Eärendil the\nMariner, Eärendil the Blessed, and Bright Eärendil.\n\nName history\n\nTolkien created the name based on Old English literature. Tolkien's\nhimself states (_Letters, 297_) that the name is derived from\nAnglo-Saxon _éarendel_. He says that he was struck by the “great beauty”\nof the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as\n\n    _entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a\n    peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language._\n\nThere is a poem by Tolkien dated to 1914 entitled _The Voyage of\nEärendel the Evening Star_ (published in HoME 2 267 - 269). Tolkien was\nalso aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse _Aurvandill_,\nLombardic _Auriwandalo_), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one\nrather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in\nthe mythology is alluded to in the _Notion Club papers_. The Old Norse\ntogether with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth,\nthe name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon\nin particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun\n(in _Crist_ Christianized to refer to John the Baptist).\n\nTolkien was particularly inspired by the lines:\n\n    _Crist_, _éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum\n    sended_\n    “Hail Earendel, brightest of angels, sent over Middle-earth to men.”\n\nThis was the inspiration not only for the role of Eärendil in Tolkien's\nwork, but also for the term “Middle-earth” (translating _Middangeard_)\nfor the inhabitable lands (c.f. Midgard).\n\nThe first line is paralleled by Frodo's exclamation in Cirith Ungol,\n_Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!_ which is Quenya, and translates to\n“Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars.” Frodo's exclamation was in\nreference to the 'Star-glass' he carried, which contained the light of\nEärendil's star, the Silmaril. It also echoes Eönwë's exclamation who at\nthe end of the First Age greeted Eärendil and his quest in Aman.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nEärendil was described as the following:\n\n\nConcept and creation\n\n\n\nIn 1914, Tolkien wrote a poem “The Voyage of Eärendil the Evening Star”\nwhich was inspired by the “Crist” poem of Cynewulf. While studying at\nOxford, Tolkien developed a constructed language that later became known\nas Quenya. Already around 1915 he had the idea that this language needed\nan internal history and was spoken by Elves whom his invented character\nEärendil meets during his journeys. The next step in the creation of the\nunderlying mythology was the _Lay of Eärendil_, a work composed of\nseveral poems that describes the mariner Eärendil and his voyages and\nhow his ship is turned into a star. The mysterious land of Valinor and\nits Two Trees of gold and silver were first described in this cycle.\n\nTolkien's legend of Eärendil has elements resembling the medieval Celtic\nImmram legends or the Christian legend of St. Brendan the Navigator.\n\nHumphrey Carpenter in his biography of Tolkien remarked that Eärendil\n“was in fact the beginning of Tolkien's own mythology”.",

His father's sister,\nEsmeralda Took, was the mother of Meriadoc Brandybuck, thus making\nPippin and Merry first cousins.\n\nThrough his father, Pippin was the second-cousin once-removed of Frodo,\nand the first-cousin twice-removed of Bilbo Baggins.\n\nFellowship of the Ring\n\nWhile on their way to Buckland, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and\nPeregrin Took encountered a Black Rider, who was warded off by the\npresence of the company of Elves, led by Gildor Inglorion. Meriadoc\nBrandybuck later joined them once they reached Buckland. They were\nwaylaid by Old Man Willow in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil rescued\nthem and took them into his house. On the way to Bree, Pippin was\ncaught up with the Barrow-wights on the Barrow-downs. After the\nencounter, Pippin acquired a Dagger of Westernesse.\n\nIn The Prancing Pony, Frodo accidentally slipped the One Ring upon his\nfinger, drawing the attention of the Black Riders. Their group met a\nRanger of the North, Strider. The inn was attacked by the Nazgûl at\nnight, and the four hobbits were successfully led away by Strider, whose\nreal name was Aragorn.\n\nAragorn led them to Weathertop, where the group was once again attacked\nby the Black Riders. In haste to get an injured Frodo to Rivendell,\nthe Elf-lord Glorfindel arrived and guided them.\n\nAfter the Council of Elrond, Pippin and Merry were allowed by Gandalf to\njoin the Fellowship of the Ring. [] In Moria, Pippin's curiosity\ndropped a stone down the well, which lead to the beating drums from\nbeneath the ground. It incurred Gandalf's wrath, and he called Pippin a\n“Fool of a Took”.\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\n\nDuring the Skirmish at Amon Hen, Pippin and Merry were protected by\nBoromir, who was killed in the process. The two hobbits were taken away\nby the Uruk-hai, mistaking them to be the Ring-bearer. On their way\nto Isengard, Pippin dropped the elven-brooch he received from\nLothlórien, as a sign for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who were in\npursuit.\n\nWhen a company of the Rohirrim ambushed the Uruk-hai, Pippin and\nMerry were able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ent\nTreebeard. They drank Ent-draughts, which gave them incredible\nheights. Pippin and Merry befriended Treebeard and told him what\nhappened to them. After the Entmoot, the Ents decided to march against\nIsengard.\n\nAfter the battle, Pippin and Merry were sitting on their “field of\nvictory”. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were reunited with them.\n\nGuard of the Citadel\n\nIn Orthanc, Pippin picked up the _palantír_, which Gríma Wormtongue\nthrew. As he looked into the stone, Pippin had a first-hand encounter\nwith Sauron himself, leading the Dark Lord to assume Pippin was the\nRing-bearer. Gandalf and Pippin then rode on Shadowfax and went to\nGondor, for the latter's protection from Sauron's forces. Pippin met\nDenethor II, the Ruling Steward of Gondor and Boromir's father. In\nreturn for Boromir's death, Pippin pledged his allegiance to Denethor\nand became the Guard of the Citadel.  While in Minas Tirith, Pippin befriended Beregond, a\nfellow Guard of the Citadel, and Faramir, Boromir's younger brother.\nDuring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Pippin witnessed Denethor\npreparing a pyre for him and an unconscious Faramir. He quickly went out\nin search for Gandalf and saved Faramir from being burned to death.\nDenethor, however, was not rescued and threw himself off of Minas\nTirith.\n\nPippin was among the Army of the West, which was led by Aragorn. They\nassaulted the Black Gate to divert the attention of the Eye of Sauron\nand give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring. In the battle, Pippin\nmanaged to kill one of the Olog-hai, a troll-race bred by Sauron, the\nfirst hobbit ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the troll\nfell on him. Gimli later recognized the Hobbit feet under the Troll and\ndragged him out of the battle, saving his life. After the\nrestoration of the monarchy, King Elessar knighted him and granted him\nand his fellow hobbits leave to return home, as well as leave to return\nto Gondor whenever they liked. Later, he, Merry, Frodo, and Sam were\ninstrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of Saruman's forces\nduring the Scouring of the Shire.\n\nAfter the War\n\nIn the year FO 6 of the Fourth Age Pippin married Diamond of Long\nCleeve, when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, Faramir\nTook I, who later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks\nGardner.\n\nIn the year FO 13, Pippin became the 32nd Thain of the Shire, a position\nhe held for 50 years before retiring in FO 63, when he revisited Rohan\nand Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his\nlife.\n\nPippin probably died sometime after the year FO 64 and was laid to rest\nwith Merry in Gondor. After the great King Elessar (Aragorn) died in FO\n120, Merry and Pippin were entombed next to the great king.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _PEREGRIN_ was derived from the Latin word _peregrinus_\n(“pilgrim”).\n\nRAZANUR TÛK was the Westron of Pippin, which comes from _raza_\n(“stranger”) and _razan_ (“foreign”). It was a name of a legendary\ntraveller. \n\nTitles\n\n-   THAIN PEREGRIN I - Pippin's title when he became a Thain of the\n    Shire.\n-   _ERNIL I PHERIANNATH_ - It is the Sindarin for “Prince of the\n    Halflings”; given to Pippin by the people of Minas Tirith.\n-   GUARD OF THE CITADEL - Given to him by Denethor II, Ruling Steward\n    of Gondor\n-   KNIGHT OF GONDOR - Given by King Aragorn II Elessar\n-   COUNSELLOR OF THE NORTH-KINGDOM - Granted to him when he became\n    Thain of the Shire.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nThe hair on his head and his feet (which are exceptionally hairy, even\nfor a Hobbit) was almost golden and curly. At the beginning of Quest of\nthe Ring, he was smaller than the rest of the Hobbits because he was the\nyoungest. But after he and Merry drank the draft from Treebeard, they\nbecame some of the tallest hobbits in history, towering at over four and\na half feet. It was said he should stop growing as hats would become\nvery expensive.\n\nIn _The Fellowship of the Ring_, he was a worthy accomplice to Merry's\nplans, although he showed his age as well; he was a cheerful if not a\nsometimes thoughtless Hobbit, and seemingly had a knack for doing the\nwrong thing at the wrong time, but throughout _The Lord of the Rings_ he\nbecomes increasingly mature and courageous.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nPippin, like Merry, used swords of the Westernesse they obtained from\nthe Barrow-downs. When he arrived in Minas Tirith he gained a sword that\nhe later called Troll's bane.",

    "text": "AMROTH was an Elven king of Lothlórien.\n\nAlthough he was descended from the Sindarin Elves, Amroth was pleased to\nadopt the customs of the Galadhrim and to live in a high house on Cerin\nAmroth, a hill in Lothlórien.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\nWhen Amroth's father, Amdír, was killed during the Battle of Dagorlad in\nSA 3434, Amroth became the King of Lothlórien. He became the last of the\nruling Sindar over Lorien.\n\nAmroth and Nimrodel\n\nAmroth's beloved, a beautiful Elf Maiden named Nimrodel, regretted that\nElves from Beleriand, which was under assault by Morgoth, were being\nadmitted into Lothlórien. She believed that these foreign Elves brought\nwars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once\nenjoyed. When a Balrog was awakened in Moria by the delvings of the\nDwarves and they fled north to the Grey Mountains, many of the Elves\nliving on the west side of Lórien moved inward, and the Galadhremmin\ntightened their guard. Nimrodel, living on the west side of the forest\nby the stream that afterward bore her name, preferring not to mix with\nthe Galadhremmin who she deemed invaders of the golden wood, instead\nfled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to\nthe forest, which was much closer to Lothlórien than it later became.\nUpon attempting to enter the forest, Nimrodel was halted and badly\nfrightened by the movements and murmurings of the Black Huorns who\nbarred her entrance. She lingered on the edge of the forest, unsure of\nwhat to do. Amroth found her there a day later.\n\nThere, Amroth and Nimrodel spoke long and earnestly with one another,\nAmroth begging for her favor. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that\nshe would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.\n\nAmroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time\ncame when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at\npeace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again.\nHe suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering\nSeas to the Undying Lands.\n\nAmroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a\nhaven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those\nelves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was\naware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to\nany of the other elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made\nthe necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.\n\nHowever, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked\nfor Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south\ntowards the Sundering Seas.\n\nFate\n\nAt the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few\nremaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to\nleave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they\nwelcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They\nhoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the\nWhite Mountains, where many unfriendly Men and evil creatures lived.\n\nThe summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was\nexpected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that\nAmroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from\ntheir houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for\nmany weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not\narrive.\n\nOne night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor\ncame from the Northern Wastes, swept through Eriador and caused an\nenormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men\nof Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind\nbroke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far\nfrom the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.\n\nAt dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when\nAmroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full\nof despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the\nwater below and drowned.\n\nThe ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely\nthat the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol\nEressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the\nGreat Journey.\n\nNeither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were\nmany legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Elf Maiden shared her name with a stream where she once lived, which\nindirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend,\nAmroth's voice continued to emanate from the sea and Nimrodel's voice\noften resonated from the stream that shared her name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Amroth_ means “upclimber” or “high climber”, from _am_ (“high, going\nup”). It refers to his having built and dwelt in a flet high in the\ntrees on Cerin Amroth. The name was of Lemberin language (later\n“Avarin”), along with other Sindarin names such as _Legolas_,\n_Nimrodel_, and _Thranduil_.\n\n\nAmroth in Song\n\nLegolas sang an extract from a long and sad song to Frodo Baggins by the\nbanks of the Nimrodel. The song, which depicted the story of Amroth and\nNimrodel, was sometimes sung in Rivendell.\n\n An Elven-maid there was of old, A shining star by day: Her mantle white\nwas hemmed with gold, Her shoes of silver-grey.\n\nA star was bound upon her brows, A light was on her hair As sun upon the\ngolden boughs In Lórien the fair.\n\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white, And fair she was and free; And\nin the wind she went as light As leaf of linden-tree.\n\nBeside the falls of Nimrodel, By water clear and cool, Her voice as\nfalling silver fell Into the shining pool.\n\nWhere now she wanders none can tell, In sunlight or in shade; For lost\nof yore was Nimrodel And in the mountains strayed.\n\nThe elven-ship in haven grey Beneath the mountain-lee Awaited her for\nmany a day Beside the roaring sea.\n\nA wind by night in Northern lands Arose, and loud it cried, And drove\nthe ship from elven-strands Across the streaming tide.\n\nWhen dawn came dim the land was lost, The mountains sinking grey Beyond\nthe heaving waves that tossed Their plumes of blinding spray.\n\nAmroth beheld the fading shore Now low beyond the swell, And cursed the\nfaithless ship that bore Him far from Nimrodel.\n\nOf old he was an Elven-king, A lord of tree and glen, When golden were\nthe boughs in spring In fair Lothlórien.\n\nFrom helm to sea they saw him leap, As arrow from the string, And dive\ninto the water deep, As mew upon the wing.\n\nThe wind was in his flowing hair, The foam about him shone; Afar they\nsaw him strong and fair Go riding like a swan.\n\nBut from the West has come no word, And on the Hither Shore No tidings\nElven-folk have heard Of Amroth evermore.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nAmroth was briefly the son of Galadriel and Celeborn, brother of\nCelebrían. In this version, he lived in Eregion and fled with Galadriel\nand Celebrían between TA 1350 and TA 1400.\n\nHe was called as Ammalas in earlier writings, and was the lover of\nInglorel (Nimrodel).",

    "text": "ELROND (Sindarin; IPA: “Star-Dome”) Half-elven, LORD OF RIVENDELL, was\none of the mighty Elf-rulers of old who lived in Middle-earth from the\nFirst Age to the beginning of the Fourth Age. He was the father of Arwen\nUndomiel, lover of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nElrond Half-elven is the son of Eärendil and Elwing, and a\ngreat-grandson of Lúthien. He was born in the refuge of the Havens of\nSirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the\nSons of Fëanor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and\nraised by Maedhros and Maglor, the Sons of Fëanor. Though at first there\nwas no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and\ncherished them, and eventually grew to love them. By the end of the\nFirst Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of Fëanor were again working\nalone, suggesting that by this time Elrond and Elros had left their\nnominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.\n\nSecond Age\n\nElrond and Elros were given the choice at the end of the First Age to be\ncounted among Men or Elves. Elros chose the Fate of Men and became Elros\nTar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor. Elrond chose to be counted\namong the Elves, and remained in Lindon as captain and herald of\nGil-Galad, the High King of the Ñoldor.\n\nIn SA 1695, Elrond was sent to Eregion by Gil-galad in an attempt to\nprotect it from the invading forces of Sauron. Unfortunately, Elrond's\nhost was too weak and was unable to hold off Sauron's army. He retreated\nnorth with a host of elves out of Eregion including Celeborn and\nremained ever watchful of Sauron from there. It was during the following\ntwo years (SA 1697) that Elrond founded Rivendell at the feet of the\nMisty Mountains, which survived as one of the last remaining strongholds\nagainst Sauron at the end of the Third Age.\n\nAfter the combined forces of the elves under Gil-Galad, Cirdan, Elrond\nand the Men of Númenor defeated Sauron in SA 1701 Elrond remained in\nRivendell and hosted the first White Council, attended by Galadriel, at\nwhich it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would\nremain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the\nThree Rings then held by Gil-Galad and Galadriel would remain hidden.\nAccording to one account Gil-Galad at this time gave Elrond Vilya the\nBlue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-Galad kept both Narya and Vilya\nuntil the end of the Second Age. It was also here that Elrond first met\nCelebrían, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel.\n\n\n\nNear the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-Galad in the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men, which set out from Rivendell to Mordor in SA\n3431. Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron. The\nAlliance, which also included elves from Lorien, men from Arnor and\nGondor, and Dwarves led by Durin lV, eventually defeated Sauron's army\nand laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually, Sauron himself\nwas defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One\nRing from Sauron's finger and claim the Ring for himself.\n\nThe Last Alliance of Elves and Men took a toll on the forces of both\nElves and Men. Gil-Galad, Elendil, and his younger son Anarion were\nkilled in the siege. Elrond and Cirdan only remained as the commanders\nof the elves, and Isildur as lord of men. Upon discovering that Isildur\nhad claimed the One Ring for himself Elrond urged Isildur to throw the\nRing into the fires of Mount Doom, but the seduction of the ring made\nIsildur refuse. Isildur claimed the Ring as a Weregild for his father\nand brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of\nthe One Ring) acknowledged his claim. Isildur was then named High King\nof Gondor and Arnor and took his father's throne, while Elrond returned\nto Rivendell at the end of the war.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nIn the year TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. In the year TA 130, the\ntwins Elladan and Elrohir were born, and in TA 241 a daughter, Arwen\nUndómiel. Elrond lost Celebrían in TA 2510 when she was waylaid by orcs\ncrossing the Misty Mountains and, unable to recover, took a ship to the\nUndying Lands.\n\nIn the later years, he was instrumental in harboring the heirs of\nIsildur while the line lasted, the most famous of these sons of men was\nAragorn son of Arathorn II, whom he took in and fostered as his own\nafter his father died in TA 2933. Elrond, foreseeing the boy's difficult\nfuture gave him the name Estel, Sindarin for Hope. Aragorn grew up in\nImladris unaware of his kingly lineage until Elrond told him when he had\nreached his manhood.\n\nHe also was a member of the White Council, which was often held in\nRivendell, and was a great friend of Gandalf the Grey. He helped Thorin\nOakenshield's expedition to retake the Lonely Mountain by discovering\nand translating the Moon Writing on Thorin's map.\n\nAfter Frodo's departure from the Shire with the One Ring, Elrond sent\nout riders to help guide him back to Rivendell. One of these,\nGlorfindel, successfully found Frodo and helped him reach Rivendell.\nOn October 25, 3018 he held the Council at which it was decided to\nattempt to destroy the One Ring. He appeared to have selected the\nmembers of the Fellowship other than Frodo and Sam.\n\nLater, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir with the Rangers of the\nNorth to Rohan. Through his sons, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the\nPaths of the Dead.\n\n\n\nElrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the One Ring and\nof Sauron, after which he went to Minas Tirith to surrender the Sceptre\nof Annúminas to King Elessar and give his daughter Arwen Undómiel away\nto be married. On September 29, 3021, Elrond left Middle-earth to go\nover the sea with the other Ring-bearers, never to return.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nELROND is a Sindarin name that means “Star-dome” or “Elf of the cave”,\nfrom _el_ (“Elf” or “star”, interchangeably) and _rond_ (“cave,\nvault”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nElrond was a skillful warrior in battle and had commanded various armies\nof the Free Peoples well, including the Last Alliance. He was just as\neffective at leadership and gave much wise counsel. He had the gift of\nforesight through which he could view lands and events far away from\nRivendell. He was also adept at healing others, though whether through\nmedical knowledge or magic isn't known. The latter may be more probable\nin that Elrond managed to cure a Morgul wound, something which is almost\ninvariably fatal due to its association with dark sorcery. While it is\nunknown just how powerful Elrond is compared to other Elf Lords, he\ncertainly holds vast potential, being descended from the angelic Maia\nMelian and being the wielder of the ring of power Vilya. A notable\ndemonstration includes Elrond summoning a great flood on the River\nBruinen to sweep away the Nazgûl. Elrond was also familiar with ósanwe,\nthe skill of entering others' minds. After the destruction of the One\nRing Elrond communicated mentally with Galadriel and Gandalf on their\nreturn journey from Minas Tirith.\n\nElrond was one of the most incorruptible of leaders of Middle-earth.\nAragorn speculated that among the few capable of completely resisting\nSaruman's power of speech were Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf. Elrond\nalso rejected and opposed Sauron when the latter offered partnership\nwith the Elves.",

    "lotr_page_id": "206",
    "text": "[]\n\nSAMWISE GAMGEE, known as SAM, was a Hobbit of the Shire. He was Frodo\nBaggins' gardener and best friend. Sam proved himself to be Frodo's\nclosest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the Fellowship\nof the Ring, and also played a necessary role in protecting Frodo and\ndestroying the One Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nSam was the youngest son of Hamfast and Bell Gamgee, and had many\nbrothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple\nHobbit of plain speech. However, his love for Elves, his gift for\npoetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most\nhobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) set him\napart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in Tolkien's\nnovels) the theme of the Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle\nforeshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's final journey across the sea from the\nGrey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known as “The\nGaffer”, on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. Sam's mother was\nBell Goodchild. He had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and\nMarigold.\n\n\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\nAs “punishment” for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo\nregarding the dangers of the One Ring, Gandalf chose Sam be Frodo's\ncompanion on his journey to Rivendell. Sam saved Frodo's life more than\nonce during the quest to destroy the Ring, and accompanied him all the\nway to Mount Doom.\n\nAfter Shelob attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the Ring,\nintending to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for\na time, he was considered one of the Ring-bearers and during the time he\npossessed it the Ring tempted him with visions of a great garden all for\nhimself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and\ntemptations of the Ring, and returned it when he discovered Frodo alive\nin the Tower of Cirith Ungol. He and Bilbo were the only ones ever to\nhave given up the ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.\n\nWhen Orcs took Frodo's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Frodo\nwas still alive, so he followed the Orcs into the Tower of Cirith Ungol,\ndetermined to rescue Frodo. Once there he found that competing bands of\nUruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the\npossession of Frodo's Mithril coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get\nto Frodo and escape the tower with him. \n\nSam and Frodo made their way to Mount Doom, disguised as Orcs along the\nway. The way to Mount Doom was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of\nash which made it almost impossible for the hobbits to pass. When Frodo\ncollapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Mount Doom,\nonly to be stopped by Gollum. Sam delayed Gollum while Frodo walked on\nto the volcano. As Sam, following Frodo, reached and entered the door of\nthe Sammath Naur he didn't notice Gollum following behind. Sam yelled\nfor Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its power and\nclaimed the Ring for himself, putting it on his finger and disappearing\nfrom Sam's sight. Just then Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his\nhead on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he came to he\nsaw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put on the Ring).\nThen Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was reunited with\nhis treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he toppled off the\nbrink and fell into the depths, destroying the One Ring, and him dying\nin the process with it.\n\nThe two hobbits managed to escape the crumbling mountain, just as the\nvolcano erupted, only to be left helpless atop the remains of giant\nrock,engulfed in a sea of lava . As their demise approached, Sam\nconfessed his love for the beautiful hobbit, Rosie Cotton, a fellow\nresident of Hobbiton, that he dreamed of one day marrying. Sam and Frodo\neventually collapsed from exhaustion, but were spotted by Gwaihir the\nLord of Eagles and with his Eagle companions. Landroval and Meneldor\nrescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to the safety of Minas Tirith.\n\n\n\nAfter recovering from their strenuous and substantial injuries Frodo and\nSam were greeted by the rest of The Fellowship, who praised the two\nHalfling's for completing their mission. Sam and the rest of the\nhobbits, remained in Gondor to bear witness to Aragorn's Coronation\nCeremony. Many of Middle Earth's esteemed leaders and famed warriors\nwere in attendance as the new King of Gondor was crowned. Aragorn,\ngreeted many of the brave souls who had helped the Fellowship on their\njourney's, but non more so than the four brave hobbits who stood before\nhim. Aragorn and the rest of the city, bowed to the four halflings, in\nadmiration for thier brave acts that ensured the safety of all\nMiddle-earth.\n\nWith the threat of Sauron's return vanquished and the One Ring\ndestroyed, the four hobbits returned to the Shire, where they settled in\nonce again.\n\n\n\nAfter the War of the Ring\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and the end of the Third Age, Sam married Rose\n(Rosie) Cotton. They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Frodo,\nRose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby,\nRobin, and Tolman. When Frodo Baggins announced that he was leaving to\nthe Undying Lands, west of Middle-earth, he gave Sam the Red Book of\nWestmarch and the household of Bag End where he and his large personal\nfamily later called the Gardners would live for many years. After Will\nWhitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Delving, in SR 1427, Sam\nwas elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive 7-year terms.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater years\n\nAfter his wife died in the year 61 of the Fourth Age (SR 1482), Sam\nentrusted the Red Book to his daughter, Elanor and left the Shire. It is\na tradition handed down from Elanor that he went to the Grey Havens, and\nbecause he was also a Ring-bearer (albeit for a short time), he was\nallowed to pass over the Sea to be reunited with Frodo in the Undying\nLands.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTolkien took the name from Gamgee Tissue, a surgical dressing invented\nby a 19th century Birmingham surgeon called Joseph Sampson Gamgee.\n“Gamgee” became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool;\nTolkien described why he had chosen that name for his character:\n\nIt is possible that Tolkien may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Gamgee\n(who died in 1886 but is commemorated by a plaque at the Birmingham\nMedical Institute, only yards from Tolkien's childhood home) but he\nclaimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a\nletter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in _The Lord\nof the Rings_ but had not read the book. Tolkien replied on March 18:\n\n\n\nHe proceeded to send Mr. Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of\nthe book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in Tolkien's\nmind, as he recorded in his journal:\n\nIn the Appendix F of _The Lord of the Rings_, Tolkien tells us that the\nWestron form of Sam's name is BANAZÎR GALBASI (_also spelled Galpsi_).\n_Banazîr_ comes from elements meaning “halfwise” or “simple”; Tolkien\nreplaced it with _Samwise,_ a modernization of the ancient English\n_samwís_ which corresponds closely in meaning. _Galbasi_ comes from the\nname of the village _Galabas_. The name _Galabas_ uses the elements\n_galab-_, meaning “game”, and _bas-_, corresponding somewhat to “-wich”\nor “-wick”. Tolkien's English translation, _Samwís Gamwich_, could have\ncome to _Samwise Gamgee_ in modern English. Sam is also known as Perhael\nin Sindarin.",

    "text": "GLORFINDEL was one of the mighty of the Firstborn (the Elves), and was\nonce the Lord of the House of the Golden Flower in Gondolin. After his\ndeath, he was re-embodied by the Valar to act as an emissary.\n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nGlorfindel was born in Tirion sometime during the Noontide of Valinor,\nand was descended from a house of princes. He followed the House of\nFingolfin during the Flight of the Ñoldor, but he took no part in the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nAfter the exile, Glorfindel followed Turgon to Gondolin. He was\nappointed as the Lord of the House of the Golden Flower and one of the\ncaptains of the King. He was popular and well-loved by the Gondolindrim.\n\nWhen Aredhel wished to depart Gondolin in search for the Sons of Fëanor,\nTurgon appointed Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth to be her escorts.\nThey were denied entrance to Doriath, and instead turned north where the\nescort lost Aredhel near Nan Dungortheb. They later returned to Gondolin\nwithout her.\n\nAlong with King Turgon, Glorfindel fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad,\nholding the King's flanks as they retreated towards the Pass of\nSirion.\n\nFall of Gondolin\n\n\n\nIn FA 510, the forces of Melkor attacked Gondolin, with the help of\nMaeglin's treachery. Glorfindel and the last of his followers held the\nGreat Market from the Orcs, in pursuance of ambushing the enemies.\nHowever, they themselves were ambushed and fought until a fire-drake\narrived. Glorfindel and his people cut their way out, but were pursed by\nthe orcs. The House of the Harp arrived to help them, after disobeying\ntheir deceitful lord, Salgant. The House of the Golden Flower regrouped\nat the Square of the King and was one of the last Houses to fight.\n\n\n\nGlorfindel joined Tuor in defending the Square, until Egalmoth arrived\nand Ecthelion was slain during his fight with Gothmog. When King Turgon\nwas also slain, the Gondolindrim escaped through Idril's Secret Way,\nwith Glorfindel holding the rear manfully and lost more of his followers\nthere.\n\nAs they made their escape through Cirith Thoronath, one of the Balrogs\ncame upon the refugees. Glorfindel leapt forward to face the Balrog,\nwhile his followers watched from afar. He fended himself from the\nBalrog's whip and claws, and successfully hewed its iron helm. At the\nlast moment, he pierced the Balrog's belly and it fell backwards towards\nthe cliff, but it grabbed Glorfindel by his hair and both of them fell\ninto the deep abyss. His body was later borne up by Thorondor, Lord of\nEagles, who flew down into the Abyss to rescue Glorfindel's broken body,\nreturning it to his people who buried him high on the cliffs of the\nMountains which surrounded Gondolin. It was said that yellow flowers\n(possibly celandine) grew on his mound, despite its rocky location.\n\nSecond Age\n\nReturn to Middle-earth\n\nGlorfindel's spirit departed to the Halls of Mandos, where he spent\nyears with the spirits of the others who died. Due to his noble actions,\nvalor and bravery that saved many Elves during the Fall of Gondolin, he\nwas re-embodied after a short time.\n\nA thousand years later, in SA 1600, Manwë sent him back to Middle-earth\nas an emissary of the Valar and granted him powers nearly as strong as\nthat of the Maiar's.\n\nThird Age\n\nIt is possible that Glorfindel remained for a time in Lindon along with\nthe other noble Elves, such as Gil-galad, Círdan, and Elrond, a\ndescendant of Tuor and Idril.\n\nBattle of Fornost\n\n\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Glorfindel was the major reason the evil\nWitch-King of Angmar was defeated. After the battle was over, and the\nWitch-King had fled, it was Glorfindel who predicted that no mortal man\nwould ever destroy the Witch-king. This prediction would come true a\nthousand years later at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, when Éowyn of\nRohan (a woman) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (a Hobbit) destroyed the\nWitch-King.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nA thousand years later, Glorfindel was sent by Lord Elrond to search for\nFrodo and his companions. He pursued some of the Nazgûl and drew them\naway from the Ford of Bruinen. He then found and led the company for\ndays stopping only briefly to let the Hobbits rest. When the Nazgul\napproached again, Glorfindel put Frodo on his white horse Asfaloth, and\nbade the horse take Frodo to Rivendell. Asfaloth out ran the black\nhorses of the Nazgûl and managed to cross the Ford of Bruinen which lead\nto Rivendell. A severely weakened Frodo, conscious but delirious due to\nthe wound he was carrying from the Morgul Blade, turned back to defy the\nRiders who pleaded for him to come with them. The Nazgul entered the\nshallow ford but were there un-horsed and swept away by a torrent of\nenchanted water which guarded the entrance to Imladris charged with the\npower of the Half-elven and indeed by Gandalf the Grey. He later led\nthe injured Frodo and the rest of the company safely to Rivendell.\n\nAt the Council of Elrond, Glorfindel sat in a position of honour\nalongside Elrond and Gandalf. He suggested that the One Ring should be\neither sent to Tom Bombadil and cast into the depths of the Sea, but\nGandalf believed that the One may resurface on land after a hundred or\nthousand years. He was briefly considered to be a member of the\nFellowship of the Ring, but was later ruled out: his power would be of\nno use in a mission of secrecy to Mordor.\n\nAfter the War\n\nAfter the Ring's destruction, Glorfindel, along with Erestor and the\nsons of Elrond, witnessed the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen. His\nultimate fate is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that he\neventually sailed to Valinor with the rest of his kin.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nGlorfindel was known for his golden hair, which at some point, was\ndescribed to be yellow. He was an elf of great bodily and spiritual\nstructure, wisdom, and bravery. The Gondolindrim loved him dearly and\nwept upon witnessing his passing at Cirith Thoronath. He was a\ncapable leader, as seen when he led his House during the Fall, and loyal\nto his King and brothers-in-arms. He was very courageous and mindful of\nthe refugees as they escaped. He chose to protect all the escaping\nGondolindrim (especially Tuor and Idril), though he “would have defended\nthem even had they been fugitives of any rank”. He displayed more of\nhis power and courage when he faced against the Nine Riders to save\nFrodo, and when he participated in the Council of Elrond.\n==Powers==\n\nGlorfindel was a very capable fighter, with great endurance; he fought\nfor hours during the Fall of Gondolin and managed to face against a\nBalrog on his own.\n\nAfter his re-embodiment, Manwë had given Glorfindel powers nearly equal\nto the Maiar's, to help him in his missions in Middle-earth. He was\nconsidered one of the most powerful elves from Rivendell, given by his\npowerful and almost “angelic” presence, which had made the Black Riders\nflee many times. He also had medicinal knowledge, as seen when he\ntends to Frodo's wounds.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis original name is said to have been LAUREFINDIL, which is the Quenya\nfor “Golden-haired”, from _laurë_ (“golden”) and _findilë_ (“head of\nhair”). _GLORFINDEL_ is simply the Sindarin translation of\nLaurefindil, from _glaur_ (“golden”) and _fîn_ or _find_ (“lock of\nhair”).\n\n\nParentage\n\nGlorfindel was said to be descended from a house of princes and one of\nthe noble elves in Gondolin. Due to his golden hair, he might be\ndescended from a Ñoldorin-Vanyarin intermarriage, like Finrod and\nGaladriel. His loyalty and following Turgon also indicated that he could\nbe one of Turgon's kin, despite Turgon and the House of Fingolfin having\ndark hair. In _The Complete Guide to Middle-earth_, it is suggested that\nGlorfindel is a member of the House of Finarfin.",

    "text": "THORIN II, also called the OAKENSHIELD, KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN or the\nMOUNTAIN KING, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin\nand Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli.\nThorin was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that\ninfiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back\nfrom Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the\nBattle of the Five Armies.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nIn the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in\nthe mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the\nother Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon\nSmaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable\nwarrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of\nAzanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies\nbeneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his\nshield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a\nshield, he gained the epithet “Oakenshield,” which would remain with him\neven in death.\n\nThorin eventually became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk after his father\nwent missing, and presumably died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.\n\nQuest for the Lonely Mountain\n\nIn TA 2941, after receiving a map\nhis father had drawn for him and following advice from Gandalf the Grey,\nhe took a contingent of Twelve Dwarves to visit Bilbo Baggins in order\nto hire him as a burglar for their cause. Thorin's intent was to\ninfiltrate the Lonely Mountain and steal back the treasure from\nSmaug.\n\nThe Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf experienced a number of dangers on their\njourney to the Lonely Mountain, surviving Trolls, Orcs, Wargs, and\nSpiders. He found the legendary sword, Orcrist, in a troll-hoard along\nwith Glamdring. In Rivendell, the Company rested and Elrond\ntranslated the moon runes in Thror's Map. During their journey\nthrough Mirkwood, Thorin and his Company encountered spiders and were\nlater imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil. They escaped through\nbarrels and they traveled down to Lake-town.\n\nThorin and Company were greeted warmly by the people of Lake-Town and\nhailed the return of the King under the Mountain. They soon reached\nthe Lonely Mountain and the Dwarves sent Bilbo who converses with\nSmaug. Realizing that the Lake-Men must have helped the intruders, an\nenraged Smaug flew towards Lake-town to take revenge on the Lake-Men.\nThere he was killed by Bard the Bowman who pierced the bare spot on\nSmaug's left breast.\n\nFollowing the death of Smaug, the people of Laketown asked Thorin for a\nshare of the treasure, as they wanted recompense for the destruction of\ntheir city, a part of Smaug's treasure originated from their former\ncity, and it was a lord of Lake-Town, who shot the fatal arrow that\nkilled Smaug. Thorin, overwhelmed by greed after recovering his family's\nriches, and enraged by the presence of Thranduil, refused to share any\npart of the treasure. Instead, he sent a raven to seek aid from his\nrelative, Dáin II Ironfoot, who had a legion of Dwarven soldiers on the\nmove to secure the reclaimed mountain city.Meanwhile, Thorin charged\nhis companions with looking for the Arkenstone within the hoard of\ntreasure. However Bilbo had already found the Arkenstone, and\nsubsequently, secretly brought it to Bard and Thranduil to use as a\nbargaining counter. When Thorin learned of Bilbo's actions he became\nenraged and denounced his former companion as a traitor.\n\n\n\nThe growing conflict over the treasure between Dwarves, Wood Elves, and\nMen, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly averted by the approach\nof Goblin and Warg armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their\ncommon enemies in what was later called the Battle of the Five Armies.\nDuring the battle, Thorin led an assault that proved his strength as a\nleader, striking out from the mountain and providing vital aid as the\ngoblins threatened to overwhelm their foes. He fought courageously, but\nwas mortally wounded in the battle, requiring Beorn to take him to\nsafety.\n\n\n\nBefore he died, he made his peace with Bilbo by commending the Hobbit's\nbravery and good character, apologising for his harsh words as he now\nrecognised his comrade's fundamentally benevolent motives. His last\nwords are, “If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded\ngold, it would be a merrier world. But, sad or merry, I must leave it\nnow. Farewell.”\n\n\nPersonality\n\nThorin was smart, proud, brave, intelligent, vengeful and a bit\nstubborn. He was infamous for a high sense of importance and rank, but\nvalued very nearly every individual of any status. He was extremely\nnoble and highly respectable with a flair of vanity about him. He was\nrespected by many throughout middle earth.\n\nHe shared the greed of his family and had an extensive love for gold,\nthough he valued the welfare of others as well. He was immensely brave\nand was willing to give himself up for any just cause, though this may\nbe to a limit since the upcoming of the Battle of the Five Armies might\nhave come as an exception.\n\nUntil the time of his death, he seemed to be cruel, stubborn and vain,\nand had a very high opinion of value. He was obsessed with possession of\nthe Arkenstone, since it was the heirloom of his family and part of the\nMountain itself.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nThorin fought using typical Dwarven axes, a bow, and swords as well as\nan Elven blade called _ORCRIST_, which he had discovered on the journey\nto the Lonely Mountain. Under Thranduil's imprisonment, the blade\nhad been confiscated by the Wood Elves. At Thorin's burial, Thranduil\ndecided it was more appropriate to place it on Thorin's tomb, and did\nso, along with the Arkenstone.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's trilogy, Thorin begins his quest with his sword, axe,\nand Oak-branch shield. He wielded his sword, Deathless, against the\nTrolls, but was forced to surrender, when the Trolls threatened kill\nBilbo. Thorin later recovered his sword after Gandalf saved them. Later,\nThorin discovered an elven blade in the Troll's hoard. Reluctant at\nfirst, Thorin later keeps the blade when Gandalf tells him that it would\nbe the best he could find. It is unknown what happens to his original\nsword, but it is presumed that he left it in the Troll hoard, as it is\nnot seen again after that. Thorin wields the sword during the orc chase,\nand slays a warg with it. When the company travels to Rivendell, Elrond\ntells Thorin that his sword's name is Orcrist. While traveling from\nRivendell to the Misty Mountains, Thorin's axe is seen as more of a\nwalking axe, then a battle axe. After the company is captured by\nGoblins, Orcrist is taken by them. When the dwarves are brought before\nthe Goblin king, Grinnah finds Orcrist, alerting the other Goblins of\nit's presence, and orders the dwarves' execution over it. When Gandalf\nsaves the dwarves, Nori gives Orcrist to Thorin, which he injures the\nGoblin King with. It is presumed that when the dwarves escape, Thorin\nloses his axe, as it is not seen again. In his battle against Azog,\nThorin uses Orcrist and his Oaken-branch against him. When the eagles\nsave the group, Thorin drops his Oaken-branch, as an eagle picks him up.\nThorin is not seen using Orcrist until Mirkwood, where he uses it to\nslay many spiders, until Mirkwood elves capture them. Legolas\nconfiscates Orcrist, and the company is captured. When the dwarves\nescape from the orcs in the barrel chase, Thorin takes swords and axes\nfrom the orcs, dropping them as he slays the orcs. After the company\ngets help from Lake-Town, Thorin uses a sword when they get to the\nLonely Mountain. In the Battle of the Five Armies, Thorin fires a\nwarning shot at Thranduil, telling him not to approach him. Thorin leads\nthe company into the Battle of the Five Armies with a sword and a\nshield, with which he slays many orcs. Thorin briefly fights Azog on\nRavenhill, where he fends off a pack of Goblin mercenaries with a\ndagger, and the help of Legolas. In the final battle, Thorin fights Azog\nwith Orcrist, which he recovered from Legolas. Azog attempts to stab\nThorin, but is prevented when Thorin uses Orcrist to block his blade. In\nthe end, Thorin gives in, and is stabbed by Azog. However, Thorin\nimpales Azog back, and thrusts Orcrist into him so hard, that the blade\npierces the ice beneath them. At his funeral, Thorin is buried with\nOrcrist, along with the Arkenstone.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nThorin was a fierce and formidable warrior, highly skilled in both\nswordsmanship and archery.",

    "lotr_page_id": "236",
    "text": "LEGOLAS was a Sindarin elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in\nthe Third Age. As he was the son of the Elvenking Thranduil of Mirkwood,\nLegolas was Prince of the Woodland Realm (Mirkwood), a messenger, and a\nmaster bowman. With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent\nbowmanship, Legolas was a valuable resource to the other members of the\nFellowship. He was well-known for becoming friends with the dwarf Gimli,\ndespite their long-held differences.\n\nIt is not known whether Legolas was Thranduil's only son, or whether he\nwas his heir. His age is unknown as well.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nLegolas was the son of Thranduil, the King of the Elves of Northern\nMirkwood. His mother is unknown\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nLegolas came to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the great meeting\nheld by the Elf lord Elrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss\nthe escape of Gollum. When the council was choosing the “Nine Walkers”\nto pit against the “Nine Riders,” Legolas volunteered to represent the\nelves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set\nout to destroy the One Ring.\n\n\n\nDuring their journey, Legolas would stay at the rear due to his keen\neyes. On Caradhras, Legolas was able to run nimbly over the snow,\nleaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plow\nthrough it. When Gandalf gave his counsel, Legolas voted against\npassing through Moria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by\nwargs and Legolas fought for their defense. After the battle, he picked\nup his arrows, save one which was damaged.\n\nGimli quarreled with him in Moria (which was not unexpected considering\nthe ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - Legolas' father\nThranduil had once imprisoned Gimli's father, Glóin.\n\nHe and Gimli became friends, however, when Gimli greeted the Elven\nqueen, Galadriel, with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from\nLorien, Legolas was given a new Galadhrim longbow. While the\nFellowship was travelling over the River Anduin, he used his new bow to\nshoot down a nearby Nazgûl with one masterful shot in the dark.\n\nLegolas and Aragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of Boromir. He\nled the rest of the Fellowship through Rohan when Merry and Pippin had\nbeen taken by the Uruk-hai. During that week, he acquired a grey horse\nnamed Arod, on which he and Gimli would often ride together.\n\nIn Fangorn Forest, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli were reunited with\nGandalf, now called Gandalf the White. Upon their meeting, Gandalf\ndelivered the messages of Galadriel to them:\n\n\n\nIn the Battle of the Hornburg, Legolas and Gimli engaged in an\nOrc-slaying contest  that Gimli won (the score being 42 to 43,\nrespectively), though Legolas was not jealous, stating, “You have passed\nmy score by one but I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see\nyou on your legs.”\n\nIn Rohan, he and Gimli followed Aragorn and Elladan and Elrohir to the\nPaths of the Dead. His horse, Arod, refused to enter the paths, and\nLegolas calmed him. Their company rode on, with Elladan on the last, but\nLegolas turned back and saw the Dead following the Grey Company.\n\nLegolas fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields with Gimli and the\nsons of Elrond. After the battle, he and Gimli entered Minas Tirith;\nLegolas sang an elven-song as he walked, and suggested that the place\nneeded more gardens. They met Prince Imrahil and went to the Houses of\nHealing, at which the cries of the gulls at Pelargir and sang a song\nabout his sea-longing.\n\n Silver flow the streams from Celos to Erui In the green fields of\nLebennin! Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea The white\nlilies sway, And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin In\nthe green fields of Lebennin, In the wind from the Sea! \n\nAfter the War\n\n\n\nAfter the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, Legolas stayed for\nthe coronation of Aragorn II Elessar and his marriage to Arwen. Later,\nhe and Gimli travelled together to Helm's Deep, visiting the Glittering\nCaves, and then later traveled through Fangorn Forest. Eventually,\nLegolas came to Ithilien with some of his people, with his father's\nleave, to live out his remaining time in Middle-earth helping to restore\nthe woodlands that had been war-torn. After Aragorn's death, Legolas\nmade a ship in Ithilien, and left Middle-earth to go over the sea. His\nstrong friendship with Gimli prompted Legolas to invite him to go to the\nUndying Lands; making him the first and only Dwarf to do so.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n\n\nThe name _LEGOLAS_ is a Silvan dialect form of pure Sindarin _Laegolas_,\nGreenleaf. It consists of the Sindarin words _laeg_ (“green”) and\n_golas_ (\"a collection of leaves, foliage, being a prefixed collective\nform of _las(s)_ “leaf”). The Quenya translation of Legolas is\n_Laiqualassë_.\n\nThere might, however, be a certain meaning to his name: _laeg_ is a very\nrare, archaic word for “green”, which is normally replaced by _calen_\n(cf. _Calenhad_, mutated _Parth Galen_ and plural _Pinnath Gelin_) and\nis otherwise almost only preserved in _Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim_ (Sindarin\nform of Quenya Laiquendi), the _Green Elves_ of the First Age. It may be\nthat Thranduil named his son _Legolas_ to at least in part refer to this\npeople, who were remote kin and ancestors of the later Silvan Elves, the\npeople Thranduil ruled.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nAlthough he lived among them and in their culture, Legolas was not fully\nof the Silvan Elves. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil, who had\noriginally come from Doriath, Legolas was at least part Sindarin Elf, as\nhis mother's identity is completely unknown. This is complicated by the\nfact that a small minority of Sindarin Elves ruled the predominantly\nSilvan Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood, a minority to which Legolas\nbelonged. The Sindarin minority in that realm, who should have been\nnobler and wiser than the Silvan Elves can be seen as having “gone\nnative” at the end of the First Age: after Morgoth was defeated and all\nof the grand Elf-kingdoms of Beleriand were destroyed, they can be seen\nas going back to “a simpler time” in their culture.\n\nLike all elves, Legolas has a great respect and appreciation for nature.\nWhile in Fangorn Forest he longed to return once more in order to\nexplore its wonders more thoroughly. He is kind, and cares greatly for\nhis friends, even Gimli the Dwarf, though it was a rarity for Elves and\nDwarves to express a liking for one another because of their feud. Due\nto his age however, he sometimes seems rather patronizing toward the\nmortals around him.\n\n\nAge\n\nTolkien does not specifically give Legolas' age but many have used what\ndetails Tolkien does give to hazard a guess. There are no known dates\nconcerning Legolas before TA 3018. It's safe to say that Legolas was\nmost likely born after Oropher, his grandfather, moved his people across\nthe Misty Mountains, since in the book he referred to the Ñoldor elves\nas a “strange race”. That would mean he's at most 5000 years old which\nplaces his birthdate in the latter part of the Second Age, at the\nearliest. Legolas is never mentioned in any account of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men, so most assume he was born in the Third Age, after\nIsildur took the Ring of Power.\n\nLegolas has never been to Lórien before he travels there with the\nFellowship. Therefore, we can assume that he was not with his\ngrandfather's people when they left Lórien for Northern Mirkwood. Before\nthe Shadow of Dol Guldur fell on Mirkwood in TA 1000, Legolas' people\nspent time amongst their Lórien neighbors. But when the Shadow fell,\nthey “retreated before it as it spread ever northward, until at last\nThranduil established his realm in the north-east of the forest and\ndelved there a fortress and great halls underground.” So it seems likely\nthat Legolas' birth-date was after TA 1000, when the Kingdom of Northern\nMirkwood was created. This would make him younger than any other elf\ncharacter in the series, including Arwen. In the Lord of the Rings\nTrilogy, Legolas refers to his travelling companions many times as\n“children”. Yet when he arrived at Fangorn, he claimed to feel young\ncompared to the forest, saying, “It is old, very old. So old that I\nalmost I feel young again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you\nchildren.”\n\n\nWeapons\n\nLegolas famously used an Elven bow, as well as a long, white knife. He\nwould prefer to pierce his enemies from afar, but his dagger was\nsometimes used for close combat. In Lothlorien, he was given a long-bow\nof the Galadhrim, which was longer and stouter than those of the fashion\nof Mirkwood.”",

    "text": "TOM BOMBADIL was an enigmatic figure that lived throughout the\nhistory of Arda. He was known by the Elves as _IARWAIN BEN-ADAR_\n(“Oldest and Fatherless” in Sindarin), who dwelt in the valley of the\nriver Withywindle, east of the Shire.\n\nA mysterious being, Tom lived in the depths of the Old Forest, close to\nthe Barrow Downs. His lands were not particularly extensive, but within\nhis domain his power over virtually everything in it was extraordinary.\nTom was a paradoxical creature, one moment defeating ancient forces with\nhardly an effort, the next capering and singing nonsensical songs. He\nlived with his wife Goldberry, “Daughter of the River,” far from any\nother settlement. Although seemingly benevolent, he took no stance\nagainst the Dark Lords.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins & First Age\n\nThe origins and nature of Tom Bombadil are unknown; however, he already\nexisted when the Dark Lord came to Arda, signifying he may have been\nalive even before the coming of the Valar. However, he may have been\nspeaking in this instance of Melkor's second entry into Arda after he\nwas driven out by the arrival of Tulkas.\n\nHis role and nature in the First Age is unknown, but he must have\nwitnessed most of the major events and battles. He also witnessed the\nreducing of the great forests that covered all Middle-earth, and perhaps\nof his powers.\n\nThe level of his interactions with the outside world is also unclear;\nhowever, he seemed to have a name among many people and perhaps became a\nfolkloric figure in the traditions and legends of Elves, Dwarves and\nMen. He has already also lived in the west much before the Elves went\nthere and the tides were folded. It had been sometime in this period,\nprobably, that he met the River-daughter, Goldberry, with whom he would\neventually marry.\n\nThird Age\n\nIt is not known when Tom settled into his\ndomain outside the Old Forest, but it is clear, by the time of the War\nof the Ring, that he has been there for quite some time. Farmer Maggot\nof Marish in the Eastfarthing and a few Bucklanders knew him and were\nfriendly with him.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nIn TA 3018, Frodo and his company had a chance meeting with Bombadil in\nthe Old Forest after a nearly disastrous encounter with Old Man Willow.\nFrodo, who had fled from the tree looking for help, enlisted Bombadil,\nwho had been out gathering water lilies. Bombadil went immediately with\nFrodo to the tree and commanded it to release its prisoners, Merry and\nPippin, which it immediately did. He then invited Frodo and his\ncompanions to his home, where the Hobbits had an almost dreamlike stay,\nfeasting and making merry with Tom. In this state, Frodo rather\ninadvertently told Tom all about the Ring and his quest, and when Tom\nasked to inspect the Ring, Frodo, without question and without any of\nthe reluctance that tended to accompany giving the Ring to another,\nallowed him to. Tom then put the Ring on his finger, yet not only did he\nnot disappear, but the Ring appeared to have no effect on him at all.\nAfter making the Ring itself vanish with a sleight-of-hand trick, he\nreturned it to Frodo, who, slightly suspicious that it had not made Tom\nvanish, put it on to make sure it was the genuine Ring. Tom surprised\nhim yet again by revealing that he could see Frodo even with the Ring\non, and told Frodo to remove it, stating that his hand was fairer\nwithout it.\n\nAfter two days resting and feasting at Tom's home, the Hobbits set out\nagain, only to be captured the next day by Wights on the Barrow-downs\nFortunately, Tom once again came to their rescue, dispersing the Wights\nand breaking open their tomb. After this, he escorted the Hobbits to\nthe borders of his land and left them there.\n\nThe peril of the hobbits was not over; an attack on their lives was\ncarried out, and their ponies were set loose. The ponies apparently\nremembered the care they were given in the house of Tom Bombadil, and\nreturned to stay beside Tom's own pony, Fatty Lumpkin. He returned them\nto Barliman Butterbur, the proprietor of The Prancing Pony. Since he had\npaid eighteen pence as compensation for the loss, he was now the owner\nof five fine ponies.\n\nOver a month later, Tom became a topic of discussion at the Council of\nElrond. There, Elrond, who had apparently met Tom in times long past,\nreminisced about him briefly before the question was put before the\nCouncil of whether or not to give the Ring to Tom, as it appeared as\nthough Tom may have had power over even the Ring within his lands.\nHowever, Gandalf quickly dismissed the idea, saying that rather than Tom\nhaving power over the Ring, the Ring simply had no power over Tom. He\nwas immune to its influence, but he could not alter it. There is however\nevidence of Toms ability to effect the rings power over others, as we\nsee Frodo freely give the ring to Tom without the usual hesitation or\nprotective behaviours. Additionally, he said that, while Tom might be\nwilling to take the Ring if asked by all the Free People of the world,\nhe might do so, but would not understand the reason. Due to this, Tom\nwould have likely either forgot about it or thrown it away, as such\nthings had little relevance to him. It was also mentioned that taking\nthe Ring back to him would be impossible to accomplish without it\nbecoming known to Sauron, and that sooner or later, Sauron would bend\nall his power towards Tom's realm to take the Ring back. Despite his\nmastery within his realm, it was assumed that Tom would not have cared\nor been able to keep the Ring contained to his realm.\n\nAfter War\n\nFour years after the One Ring was destroyed, Gandalf spent some time\nwith Bombadil. It is unknown how the meeting was or what they discussed\nbetween them. Gandalf remarked to the Hobbits that Bombadil would\ndoubtless have little interest in the tales of their adventures, except\nperhaps their encounters with the Ents.\n\n\nInterpretations and Description\n\nThere are many theories of his origins, such as of\nhim being in truth a Maia, a man, Ilúvatar himself, or even the reader,\nthough more on this can be found elsewhere (see below). He appeared as\nan old man, at least to Hobbit eyes, with a wrinkled and ruddy face,\nbright blue eyes, and a bristling brown beard. He was said to be taller\nthan a typical Hobbit, but too short to be a Man, which would put him\nsomewhere between four and a half and five feet in height. He spoke in\nstress-timed metre.\n\nHis clothing consisted of a blue jacket and yellow boots, and he wore an\nold and battered hat, surmounted by a feather. He seems to have\npreferred to wear a swan-feather in his hat, but before he met Frodo and\ncompany on the banks of the Withywindle, he had acquired the feather of\na kingfisher instead. In his own house, rather than a hat, he wore a\ncrown of autumn leaves.\n\nIn his preface to _The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,_ Tolkien tells us\nthat Tom's name is “Bucklandish in form,” and suggests that it was given\nto him by the Hobbits of that region, as he has many other names. The\nresemblance of the -dil ending to the common Elvish _(n)dil,_ “friend,”\nmay or may not be coincidental. Despite seeming to be a rather whimsical\nand nonsensical being, he was well known to many powerful beings in\nMiddle-earth, including Elrond and Gandalf, and he could be serious if\nthe need arose.\n\nSee also: _The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien_, with special reference to\nLetters 144 and 153.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nGoldberry described him as\nbeing “Master of wood, water and hill.” His power over supernatural\nbeings is evidenced by both his freeing the Hobbits from Old Man Willow\nand his rescue of them from the Barrow-wights, whose cursed treasure he\nwas also able to make clean. Here it is seen that the One Ring has no\npower over Bombadil; he can see Frodo when the Ring makes him invisible\nto others, and can wear it himself with no effect. He even tosses the\nRing in the air and makes it disappear, but then produces it from his\nother hand and returns it to Frodo. While this seems to demonstrate that\nhe has unique and mysterious power over the Ring, the idea of giving him\nthe Ring for safekeeping is rejected in Book Two's second chapter, “The\nCouncil of Elrond”. Gandalf says, rather, that “the Ring has no power\nover him...” and believes that Tom would not find the Ring to be very\nimportant and so might simply misplace it.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTom Bombadil went by many names:\n\n-   To Elves and Dúnedain he was known as IARWAIN BEN-ADAR, which\n    translates to “oldest and fatherless”. _Iarwain_ literally means\n    “Old-young”.\n-   To Men of the Vales of Anduin and Rohan, he was known as ORALD.\n    This is an Old English word meaning \"very ancient.\n-   The Dwarves knew him as FORN. This too is a reference to his\n    age: it is Old Norse for “(belonging to) ancient (days)”.\n-   _Tom Bombadil_ is said to be a Bucklandish name, added by Hobbit\n    chroniclers to his many older ones. Like most Bucklandish names, its\n    translation is unknown.",

    "text": "MÎM, or MÎM THE DWARF, was a Petty-dwarf of the First Age and\npossibly the last of the Petty-dwarves. He was mostly a part in the\nadventures of Turin Turambar.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nMîm lived with his two sons at Amon Rûdh in middle Beleriand, where he\nkept a secret treasury. During Túrin's time with the Outlaws, Mîm and\nsons were seen as they snuck past the outlaws carrying heavy sacks. Mîm\nwas captured, and arrows were shot at his sons IBUN and KHÎM.\n\nIn exchange for his life, Mîm was forced to lead the outlaws to his\nsecret halls in Amon Rûdh. There, it turned out Khîm had been killed by\nan arrow loosed by Androg, who was then forced to break his bow and\narrows, and Túrin repenting offered his service to Mîm. For this reason\nMîm tolerated the outlaws, and at the least came to respect Túrin (and\nwas even jealous of Túrin's love for Beleg).\n\n\n\nWhen Beleg Cúthalion arrived at Amon Rûdh, Mîm was angry: he hated\nElves, especially the Sindar. Nevertheless he had to tolerate the elf in\nhis halls. This hatred toward Beleg led Mim to betray Amon Rûdh to\nMorgoth. In one of the first known accounts of a wicked dwarf having an\nalliance with Orcs or goblins. After Amon Rûdh was betrayed to Morgoth,\nAll the outlaws were slain, save Túrin and Beleg. Beleg was left tied up\non the summit of Amon Rûdh by the Orcs, and there Mîm found him and\nattempted to kill him but was scared away by a dying outlaw called\nAndróg. Mîm escaped, but it seems Ibûn was killed by Orcs. Eventually\nMîm made his way to ruined Nargothrond after Túrin had killed Glaurung,\nand took the treasure for his own.\n\nHúrin Thalion, who had seen all that had happened to Túrin with\nMorgoth's eyes, with a band of outlaws. But the folk of Mîm were few,\nand the outlaws filled with the lust of the treasure slew them, though\nHúrin would have stayed them; though he deemed him partially\nresponsible for Túrin's fate (the nature of who killed the dwarf, the\nnature of the treasure, and size of Hurin's band varies in post-humus\nedited \"stories'). With his dying words Mîm cursed the treasure. Húrin's\nband brought the treasure of Nargothrond (but not before most had killed\neach other along the way brought down by the treasures curse), and\nThingol had to send his own men to bring the treasure to Doriath, where\neventually the gold was a reason for the Sack of Doriath and the death\nof Thingol.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nNote that in the published _The Silmarillion_ Mîm hardly appears. His\nrole is much expanded in the _Narn i Chîn Húrin_ as published in the\n_Unfinished Tales_, and in the _Wanderings of Húrin_.\n\nThe earliest and most revised version of Mîm's story is the story of\nhoard of Norgrothond, and has changed several several times. In some\nversions a curse is included, or hinted at, in others there is no curse.\nAs well as differences of when the curse took place (did he curse the\ngold before or after he was given a mortal wound, or both before and\nafter). Other changes include when the Necklace of the Dwarves was made;\nafter the treasure was taken (possibly made from cursed gold), or\nbefore.\n\nIn earlier versions of the _Silmarillion_ as detailed in _The History of\nMiddle-earth_ series, Mîm was a much more evil character, who actively\nbetrayed Túrin. But as Dwarves gradually changed in Tolkien's writings\nfrom evil Orc-like beings to the Dwarves they later became, Mîm's\ncharacter was changed, and in the final texts he is no longer a true\nvillain, but almost a tragic character in his own right. However in The\nChildren of Hurin certain details are taken in a darker direction, with\nMîm actively betraying Turin's company in malice and revenge, and the\nintent to kill Beleg (but only having mercy for Turin (and this mainly\nbecause he also had troubles with the elves)). It it is not nearly as\ntragic, as some of the previously published portrayals (though it does\nmake note that alternate tales are somewhat more sympathetic to the\ndwarf).\n\nMuch of Mim's framework of the original more 'evil' or 'darker' Mim in\nNargothrond is restored in Beren and Lúthien (2017) including the full\nnature of his curse, its influence on Hurin, his allies, the corruption\nof more sinister/greedy dwarves, traitorous elves, treacherous dwarves\nfrom within and without Doriath leading to its downfall, the location of\nThingol's death outside of the Thousand Caves, and dwarves defeat at\nSarn Athrad where bulk of the cursed treasure is lost, and the later\ndownfall of Dior in another Kinslaying. However, as neither Mim nor\nHurin are a focus in the story not all the details of the encounter are\ndiscussed (nor Mim's backstory).\n\nIn the Lost Tales, Mîm is the captain of the guard for Glaurung, who\nprotects his treasures while he is away. He guards the treasures along\nwith other Orcs and possible fallen elves. He curses the treasures with\nwards of protection. Húrin comes, and Mîm warns him of the curse on the\ngold both from the dragon laying on it for long years, and because he\ntoo had put magical wards on it. Only Mîm could safely handle the gold\nbecause he was put in charge of it, and had also bound the gold to\nhimself. Turin feared him at first, but was convinced by his elven guard\nto seize it all. Mîm then put many evil curses on the men. In response\nHúrin killed him as punishment for the cruel behaviour from the dwarf,\nwhen they originally had planned to just take the treasure and leave him\nalone. Mîm issues one final curse as he lay dieing that elves and men\nwould rue the deed, and that death would follow the gold as long as it\nremained on earth (the curse would effect any portion of it even if\ndivided). The elves laughed, but Húrin was bothered by it. They then\ncarried the gold away. The curse did its deed leading men to kill each\nother, elves to kill each other, men killing elves, and Dwarves killing\nelves. Finally it lead to a civil war among the Dwarves that never\nended, even after the gold was lost.\n\nIn the _The Shaping of Middle Earth_, “Mîm the Dwarf” is just a byline\nhe was a random dwarf (though the first dwarf to be mentioned by name in\nthe early histories) who had taken possession Glaurung's gold after the\ndragon had been killed along with other Dwarves of his kind. While there\nhe had enchanted all the gold (a nod back to the black songs and curses\nhe made on the gold as wards while he was the Captain of the dragon's\nguard). Húrin and his band of outlaws come to the hoard kill the other\ndwarven guards, and all slay Mîm, and take the hoard. This changes the\nstory from one person to many taking the gold (though he left out this\ngroup in some later revisions at the time). The curse goes on to lead to\nthe deaths of several factions before finally being lost. Only hint of\nMîm's character comes from the fact that he enchanted the gold (but it\ndoesn't specifically show him to be evil), but his race is however shown\nto be evil when they plot against Thingol (but this is modified in later\nrevisions and stories the Dwarves tend to lean more to sociably neutral\nbut not evil, with the evil ones being categorized under Petty-dwarves).\n\nIn the Lost Road, Mîm is only briefly mentioned in the Annals, similar\nto earlier version; Again Mîm is just a random dwarf (this time\napparently alone) that had taken over Nargothrond hoard. He slew the\ndwarf (there is no mention of any others with him), but the dwarf had\ncursed the treasure, and it is brought to Thingol. Thingol employs\nDwarves to craft him the Nauglamir. Enmity awakens between Dwarves and\nelves, and he sends them away. The Dwarves and Elves from Belegost and\nNogrod return in force and invade Doriath. They were allowed in by\ntreacherous elves who had been smitten by the curse. Thingol is slain in\nthe caves. Dwarves are later ambushed, Beren keeps the necklace, and\ngold is thrown into the river. Later, kinstrife occurs although in this\nversion it is not ascribed to the curse.\n\nThe role of traitor in Turin's band in these early writings instead\ngiven to Blodrin, a Elf that had lived among the evil Dwarves and become\nlike them. The two ideas were later merged into Mîm's character.\n\nMîm is briefly mentioned in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil in regards to\nthe poem, _The Hoard_. The poem itself written by Bilbo apparently;\nappears to be loosely inspired by the stories of the elves, the death of\nMîm, the coming of Glaurung, and the coming of Turin. In this version\nthe old dwarf (apparently Mîm the Dwarf) takes the Elven-home from the\nelves after they fall into shadow, and takes over their hoard. In time\nthe dragon comes to take over his hoard from him destroying him in the\nprocess. Then comes the warrior (apparently Turin) who slays him and\ndies in the process. The treasure is taken by his father.\n\nIn the version published in _Silmarillion_ (1977) the is no reference to\nthe curse, only the Nauglamir is taken from the hoard, and all the\nactions that occur appear to be due to greed and paranoia of all\ninvolved. In cold blooded murder and wicked actions, Thingol was slain\ninside the caves, and the Dwarves working for him steal his treasures,\nand the necklace, and then are later slain themselves.",

    "text": "MAEDHROS, also called MAEDHROS THE TALL, was one of the princes of\nthe Ñoldor, the eldest of the seven Sons of Fëanor and head of the House\nof Fëanor following the death of his father in Middle-earth. He was\nextraordinarily renowned for his skill both as a warrior and as a\ndiplomat. For hundreds of years, he led his House against the forces of\nMorgoth but the Oath that he and his six brothers had sworn to recover\nthe Silmarils constrained him and ultimately led to his death.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nMaedhros was born in Eldamar, probably in Tirion, to Fëanor and Nerdanel\nsometime during the Noontide of Valinor. After the flight of Fëanor from\nTirion in Valinor, he went with his father to Formenos. When Morgoth\nkilled Finwë and stole Fëanor's beloved Silmarils, Maedhros was the\nfirst son to take the terrible Oath of Fëanor to recover the holy\njewels.\n\nMaedhros participated in the First Kinslaying alongside his father and\nbrothers. He was however the only one of Fëanor's sons not to\nparticipate in the burning of the Teleri ships, and in fact advocated\nfor ships and oarsmen to return to Aman to ferry Fingolfin's host.\nAfter landing in Middle-earth, the Ñoldor were attacked by an army of\nOrcs, leading to the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. The Elves were victorious and\nthe remnants of the Orcish army retreated to Angband, pursued by Fëanor\nand a small vanguard. But Fëanor's force encountered a number of Balrogs\nas they approached Angband, and were quickly slain. Fëanor himself was\ndealt a mortal wound by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs, but Maedhros\nand his brothers arrived with a relief force to rescue him. However,\nFëanor died from his wounds shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\nShortly after the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, an embassy\ncame from Morgoth acknowledging defeat, and offering terms which\nincluded the possibility of surrendering a Silmaril. Maedhros did not\ntrust Morgoth, and so went to meet his embassy with more men than agreed\nupon. But Morgoth too had been expecting treachery, and so sent further\nmore troops, including Balrogs. When the two groups met, the Elves were\nquickly slain and Maedhros was captured. Morgoth then sent word to the\nElves that if they forsook their war against him, Maedhros would be\nreleased. But the Elves knew that Morgoth would not honor his word and\nsent no reply. In response, Morgoth bolted Maedhros by the wrist of his\nright hand to the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim. Shortly\nthereafter the host of Fingolfin, betrayed by Fëanor and abandoned in\nAman, came at last to Middle-earth. The people of Fingolfin, harboring\ngreat anger over Fëanor's betrayal, were not welcomed by Fëanor's host\nfor shame, and the two groups remained bitterly divided. But Maedhros's\ncousin Fingon, with whom he had been very close before the sundering of\nthe Ñoldor, set out to free him, both for the sake of their friendship\nand in an attempt to heal the division amongst his people.\n\nThe recent appearance of the Sun and Moon had prompted Morgoth to\nblanket the sky above Angband with nigh-impenetrable clouds of ash and\nsmoke to shield his servants. Aided by this darkness and the fact the\nMorgoth's legions were hiding underground from the newly made lights,\nFingon managed to reach Thangorodrim unmolested. But seeing that he\ncould not enter Angband by any means, he began to sing a song in\ndefiance of the Orcs hiding within Angband. Maedhros heard this song,\nand began to sing with Fingon, and thus Fingon managed to find him upon\nthe slopes of Thangorodrim. But when he reached the foot of the\nprecipice from which Maedhros hung, he found that there was no way to\nreach Maedhros to free him. Seeing that there was nothing Fingon could\ndo to help him and being in agony without hope of respite, Maedhros\nbegged Fingon to shoot him. Fingon made to do as Maedhros wished, but\nbefore he loosed his arrow, he prayed to Manwë to speed the arrow along\nfor Maedhros's sake. Fingon's plea for mercy was heard by Thorondor, the\nKing of Eagles, who stayed Fingon's hand and flew him to Maedhros. But\nFingon was unable to either affect the metal band from which Maedhros\nhung or draw it from the precipice. Maedhros begged Fingon for death\nonce again, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros‘s hand and Thorondor\nbore them both away from Thangorodrim. Maedhros made a swift recovery,\nbut never forgot his torment, which drove him to become an even deadlier\nswordsman with his left hand than he had ever been with his right. In\ngratitude for his rescue, and in atonement for Fëanor's betrayal,\nMaedhros relinquished all claim as the heir of Finwë and made his Uncle\nFingolfin, Fingon's father, High King of the Ñoldor, something his\nbrothers did not take well to. Maedhros openly acknowledged this action\nas being proper however, as Fingolfin was the oldest living son of Finwë\nand was therefore next in line for the throne.\n\n\n\nSeeing that his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen,\nMaedhros moved them out of Hithlum, and later ruled the lands around the\nHill of Himring, which became known as the March of Maedhros. He\nestablished there a mighty fortress city not only to separate his rash\nand fiery brothers from the people of Fingolfin, but because he wished\nto have any attack from Angband fall first upon him. Allied with\nFingolfin, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He\nstood with Fingolfin for nearly 300 years until the Dagor Bragollach,\nand thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while\nmany other elven realms fell.\n\nSoon after, he learned of Beren and Lúthien's successful quest to\nliberate a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Realizing that Morgoth was not\ninvincible, he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other\nElven Houses to create the Union of Maedhros, hoping to end the dominion\nof Morgoth forever. However, the Union was utterly broken during the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad. Himring was garrisoned by Orcs, and Maedhros and his\nbrothers fled south, taking refuge upon the hill of Amon Ereb.\n\n\n\nSeveral years later, Maedhros and his brothers learned that Elwing of\nDoriath, granddaughter of Lúthien and Beren, had inherited the Silmaril\nthat her grandparents had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the\nOath, Maedhros allowed Celegorm to convince him to attack Doriath.\nDuring the battle, Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin were slain by\nBeren's son, Dior Eluchil, the King of Doriath, but he himself was slain\nas well. Dior's sons, Eluréd and Elurín, were captured and abandoned by\nCelegorm's cruel servants in the forests around Doriath. Maedhros\nbitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent\nyouths but could not find them. After learning that Elwing had\nsurvived and had taken the Silmaril with her, he and his surviving\nbrothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of\nDoriath living in the Havens of Sirion. The Ñoldorin princes killed many\nelves and captured Elwing's sons Elrond and Elros in the sack, but she\nand her husband Eärendil escaped to the West with the jewel.\nHeartsick with the burden of the Oath and the deeds he had participated\nin to see it fulfilled, Maedhros and his brother Maglor took Elwing's\nsons under their protection.\n\n\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, he and his last surviving brother, Maglor,\ndemanded the jewels from Eönwë but were denied, as they were judged by\nthe Maia to be unworthy of the jewels due to their cruelty. However,\ndriven onward by the Oath, Maedhros convinced Maglor of the necessity of\nfulfilling it. As such, one night the two brothers snuck into the camp\nof the victorious Host of the West, slew the guard around the jewels and\nlaid hands upon them. The camp was roused, and the brothers prepared to\ndie defending their claim. But Eönwë ordered the brothers to be spared,\nand they left the camp unharmed. But because of the evil deeds committed\nby the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor's and\nMaedhros' hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and\nthe Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was NELYAFINWË (“Finwë the Third”), from the Quenya\n_nelya_ (“third”), and its shorter form is NELYO. \n\nHis mother Nerdanel called him MAITIMO (“Well-shaped one”) for he was\n“of beautiful bodily form”. His first epessë was RUSSANDOL (“Copper\ntop”), referring to his auburn hair. The second epessë MAEDHROS is\nthe Sindarin translation of Maitimo and Russandol, from the Sindarin\n_maed_ (“shapely”) and _ross_ (“red-haired”). The Quenyan MAIDHROS\nmeans “Pale-glitter”.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nMaedhros had a fierce spirit, hardened by his torment by Morgoth on\nThangorodrim, but was more temperate than his father. He was an\nexceptionally skilled swordsman despite the loss of his right hand. He\nwas well known for his handsome, comely appearance, especially his\nauburn hair, which was a contrast with his royal kin's dark hair. He was\nalso known for his skill in diplomacy, as he was able to keep the peace\nbetween the House of Fëanor and the rest of his kinsmen for hundreds of\nyears despite the rash and fiery nature of most of his brothers.",

    "text": "GIL-GALAD, originally named EREINION, was a Ñoldorin Elf, son of Fingon\n. He was the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, and bore\nmany titles, including HIGH KING OF THE ELVES OF THE WEST, King of the\nEldar, King of Lindon, Lord of the High Elves, and the Lord of Eriador.\n\nGil-galad held the highest authority among the Elves he ruled and was\nrespected by both the Ñoldor and the Sindar. He was considered the High\nKing of the Elves in Middle-earth. He formed the Last Alliance of Elves\nand Men with Elendil, and led the Elves to war against Sauron during\nthis time. His death marked the end of the Ñoldorin Kingdoms in\nMiddle-earth, though many Ñoldor would still dwell in Imladris later\nthroughout the Third Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\nGil-galad was most likely born in the fifth century of the First Age,\nand was still young during the times of the battles of the Dagor\nBragollach and Nirnaeth Arnoediad. He was the son of Fingon, tying him\ninto the House of Fingolfin. He lived in Nargothrond until its fall and\nescaped, and eventually came to the Mouths of Sirion.\n\nAfter the death of Turgon during the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad\nreceived the Kingship of the Ñoldor. When the Sons of Feanor\ncommitted the Third Kinslaying, Gil-galad received word of the sacking\nof the Havens, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Sons of\nFeanor, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of\nSirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told\nhim of Elrond and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the\nremaining Sons of Feanor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed\nsuicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and\nElros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his\nranks, after the latter chose to be one of Elf Kind.\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nIn year 1 of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and\nestablished Lindon, which was strong and secure against its enemies. At\nits height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains\nand the western parts of Greenwood the Great, though most of the Eldar\nremained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of Rivendell.\n\nGil-galad had an alliance with the Men of Westernesse, especially with\nTar-Aldarion (the Mariner), The Faithful and Elendil. Gil-galad reigned\nas High King of the Ñoldor throughout the Second Age. During this time\nGil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn, or mallorn, trees by\nTar-Aldarion, who was, during this time, High King of Numenor. But the\nseeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Galadriel before she\nleft Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting\nthem in Lindórinand. When they grew in the land, it was renamed\nLothlórien, Lórien of Blossom. At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were\napproached by a stranger called Annatar, who called himself the Lord of\nGifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad\nperceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused\nto have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that\nthey should shun this stranger.\n\nHowever Annatar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Elves how\nto make the Rings of Power. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct,\nas Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his\nwicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad was entrusted\nby Celebrimbor with the Elven Rings Vilya (Ring of Air) and Narya (Ring\nof Fire), two of the Three Rings, which he passed on to his herald\nElrond and his lieutenant Cirdan prior to his demise at the Siege of\nBarad-dûr.\n\nFor a long time Gil-galad waged war with Sauron. But the High King was\naided by the Numenoreans, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, which hindered\nSauron's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned\nto Mordor, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance\nagainst the Dunedain. He was later confronted by the Numenoreans and\nbrought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to\nrule Middle-Earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew\nto the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of\nNumenor. Yet the survivors of Numenor, known as the Faithful, arrived in\nMiddle-Earth and established their kingdoms. They retained their\nfriendship with the Elves, and both Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel\nas to how they should deal with Saruon. At length they decided to gather\nall of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his\nstrength.\n\nWith the emergence of Sauron, Gil-galad joined forces with the King\nElendil to defeat the might of Mordor, reborn again with the return of\nSauron. Their large, well-trained, united forces engaged Sauron's armies\nmultiple times in the conflict known as the War of the Last Alliance.\nGil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named Aeglos - which meant\n“Icicle”; none could withstand it. Finally, towards the end of the war,\nthe Elves and Men passed through into Mordor and laid siege to\nBarad-dûr, where Gil-galad and Elendil dueled Sauron himself. During\ntheir struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on\nthe Dark Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds\nin return. This sacrifice allowed Isildur to sever the Ring from the\nDark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from “the heat of\nSauron's hand”, and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not\nknown to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor\nended in Middle-earth and Círdan was from then on the Lord of the Grey\nHavens and Lindon.\n\n Gil-galad was an Elven-king. Of him the harpers sadly sing; the last\nwhose realm was fair and free between the Mountains and the Sea.\n\nHis sword was long, his lance was keen. His shining helm afar was seen;\nthe countless stars of heaven's field were mirrored in his silver\nshield.\n\nBut long ago he rode away, and where he dwelleth none can say; for into\ndarkness fell his star in Mordor where the shadows are.\n\n    ― From _The Fall of Gil-galad_, as translated by Bilbo Baggins\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_GIL-GALAD_ was a Sindarin word that means “Star of Radiance” , from\n_gil_ (“star”) and _galad_ (“light, radiance”).\n\nHis name in Quenya was _ARTANÁRO_ which means “High Flame”. In Sindarin,\n_Artanáro_ translates to _Rodnor_.\n\nIt was first conceived that Gil-galad's birth name was _EREINION_\ninstead of his epessë. _Ereinion_ means “Son of Kings”, from _erain_\n(“kings”) and _ion_ (“son”).\n\n\nParentage\n\nGil-galad's parentage had many versions in Tolkien's legendarium:\n\n-   Gil-galad was originally, and briefly, conceived as a descendant of\n    Fëanor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In both _The Silmarillion_ and _Unfinished Tales_, he was the son of\n    Fingon.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In some notes in _The History of Middle-earth_, it is stated that he\n    had briefly been the son of Finrod Felagund. It was said that\n    Felagund sent his wife and son away for the Falas for their safety.\n    In this version, Galadriel was Gil-galad's sister and daughter of\n    Felagund. However, Tolkien decided that Felagund was unmarried\n    and childless.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In another, Angrod had a son Artaresto (later called Orodreth) whom\n    Finrod made his steward and succeeded in Nargothrond. His wife was a\n    Sindarin lady of the North, and had two children, Finduilas and\n    Gil-galad, whom she called Rodnor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In the last, the name _Artaresto_ was replaced by _Arothir_\n    (Orodreth), which was the name of the nephew of Finrod and father of\n    Gil-galad. Finduilas remained as Orodreth's daughter and became\n    sister of Gil-galad.\n\n\n\nA marginal note by Tolkien from around this time (the late 1950s)\nsuggested that Gil-galad might have been the son of Fingon. This\nsuggestion was taken up by Tolkien's son and literary executor\nChristopher Tolkien in the published version of _The Silmarillion_,\nwhich states that Gil-galad is the son of Fingon. After the Dagor\nBragollach and the ruin of Beleriand which resulted in the death of his\ngrandfather Fingolfin, then High King of the Noldor, Fingon becomes the\nHigh King and sends a young Gil-galad to the Havens of the Falas under\nCírdan. This idea of Gil-galad being sent to the Havens was derived\nfrom material which the elder Tolkien had written at the time when he\nsaw Gil-galad as the son of Finrod.\n\nAfter the disaster of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the title passes to\nFingon's brother Turgon. Morgoth assaults the Falathrim in great force\nafter that battle but Círdan and Gil-galad manage to flee in their ships\nto the Isle of Balar. When tidings come to Balar about the sack of\nGondolin and the death of Turgon, Gil-galad becomes the King.\nGil-galad's name in the chapter “Aldarion and Erendis” in _Unfinished\nTales_ was also changed by the younger Tolkien in order to keep\nconsistency with the published version of _The Silmarillion_. — in the\noriginal version of that work he was noted as a son of Finrod.\nChristopher later stated in _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ that this\ndecision to make Gil-galad a son of Fingon was an editorial mistake on\nhis part, and did not represent his father's conception of the\ncharacter. He suggested that it would have been better to have left\nGil-galad's parentage obscure.\n\nTolkien's final decision for Gil-galad's parentage appears to have been\nthat he was a son of Orodreth, who was at the same time changed from\nbeing a son of Finarfin to a son of Angrod. This conception, however,\nwas never incorporated into the written stories of _The Silmarillion_,\nand aspects of it — notably the downgrading of Orodreth into a son of\nAngrod — would have required considerable reworking of the existing\ntext. Moreover, if Gil-galad were the son of Orodreth then he would not\nhave been High King, as the kingship belonged to the House of Fingolfin.\nIn the official text of _The Silmarillion_, Gil-galad receives the\nkingship as he is the son of Fingon, who in turn is the son of\nFingolfin.",

    "text": "_'Radagast (ADÛNAIC; IPA:  - “TENDER OF BEASTS”) the Brown_',\nalso called '''Aiwendil '''(Quenya; IPA:  -\n“Bird-Friend”) was one of the five Wizards, or _Istari_. He was a good\nfriend of Gandalf the Grey, whom he aided occasionally. Radagast was\nmainly concerned with the well-being of the plant and animal worlds, and\nthus did not participate heavily in the War of the Ring.  \n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n\n\nRadagast was originally a Maia of Yavanna the Fruit-Giver named\nAIWENDIL, meaning “bird-friend”. In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a\ncouncil was called by Manwë, leader of the Valar, shortly after Sauron's\ndefeat in the War of the Last Alliance. Though Sauron was overthrown, it\nwould later turn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his\nshadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to\nsend five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be “mighty peers of\nSauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,” as they were\nintended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards\nwere forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.\n\nThe other four who were chosen were Gandalf, Saruman,\nand Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Yavanna subsequently begged\nCurumo to take Aiwendil with him.\n\nArrival in Middle-earth\n\nAround the year 1000, the Maiar arrived at the Grey Havens in the west\nof Eriador upon the shores of Middle-earth, having the form of old Men,\nwhom the peoples called _Wizards_. Curumo arrived first and alone, and\nAiwendil arrived at the same time as Olórin.\n\nAiwendil, renamed Radagast, meaning “tender of beasts”, by the Ñoldor,\nprotects the great forests. He was little concerned with the affairs of\nMen and Elves but was far more knowledgeable in plants, birds and beasts\nin the forest. He also turned away from Saruman during this period,\nunaware that he despised him and considered him a fool.\n\nSecond Age\n\nWhen the Wizards took their mission they roamed Middle-earth, but\nRadagast was never much of a traveller. There is not much to be told\nabout his early journeys.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Gandalf says that Radagast is his cousin, though\nthis more likely refers to their friendship or the fact that they are\nboth Wizards, and not actual close kinship, except in that they are both\nMaiar.\n\nBy the late Third Age he eventually settled down and dwelt, for a time\nat least, at Rhosgobel somewhere between the Carrock and the Old Forest\nRoad. Situated on the western borders of Mirkwood, it can be assumed\nthat the Wizard held watch against the Shadow of Dol Guldur that slowly\nengulfed the forest. It is likely that he became acquainted with the\ninhabitants of that region. Close to animals and birds, he was friends\nwith the Great Eagles. Although the neighboring Beorn was unsociable,\nhe used to see him from time to time, and he considered Radagast “not\nbad” for a Wizard.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nIn 2851 the White Council met once more and, after that, Saruman began\nto search the Gladden Fields for the One Ring. Radagast decided to aid\nhis search with birds and beasts who acted as spies hoping that\nSaruman's actions would help watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this\nin good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's real ambitions to keep the\nRing for himself.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring Radagast did not dwell any more in\nRhosgobel. In summer 3018 Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to\nhelp Gandalf, and sent the Brown Wizard to seek him out at once.\nRadagast did not know much of Eriador but sought for the Shire, knowing\nthat he would find Gandalf nearby.\n\nIndeed, on Midsummer's Day, Radagast was sitting on the side of the\nGreenway with his horse near Bree when Gandalf found him on his way to\nthe village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the Nazgûl were abroad,\ndisguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of the\nShire. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf\nby getting beasts and birds to send news to Orthanc. With that he rode\naway back towards Mirkwood.\n\nBy sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured.\nSaruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in\nOrthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of\nSaruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able\nto escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of Gwaihir.\n\nRadagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not\nrecorded. After the Council of Elrond, many scouts were sent out from\nRivendell to many different locations. Some passed over the Misty\nMountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but they found that Radagast\nwas not there.\n\nHis fate after the War of the Ring is not known. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis original, AIWENDIL, meant “bird-friend” in Quenya; IPA: ). It is\ncomprised of the Quenya _aiwë_ ( “bird”) and the ending _-ndil_\n(“friend”).\n\nAccording to the essay “The Istari” from the _Unfinished Tales_,\n_Radagast_ means “tender of beasts” in Adûnaic, the language of Númenor.\nHowever, in a later note Tolkien said that the name is in the language\nof the Men of the Vales of Anduin, and that its meaning is not\ninterpretable. The name _Radagast_ may actually be Anglo-Saxon, and\ncould have several interpretations, but, according to ''The Languages of\nMiddle-earth, ''this name is derived from a Slavic pagan god. The name\nRADEGAST was a name for one of West Slavic lesser gods. He is a god of\nthe Sun, war, fertility and harvest. He is also called Radigost,\nRadegast, Radhost, Radhošť, Redigast.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nTolkien's writing does not shed much light on Radagast's personality. In\nthe books, little is known about Radagast apart from certain defining\ncharacteristics. Saruman was the chief of the Order of Wizards and\nGandalf came next in the order; Radagast meanwhile held much less power\nand wisdom.\n\nAs one of the Maiar of Yavanna, Radagast had a great interest in the\nkelvar and olvar of Middle-earth and was a friend to beasts and\nbirds. Gandalf, however, held greater respect from, and\nknowledge about, birds than Radagast.\n\nRadagast displayed some qualities of innocence and naivety, making him\nan ideal accomplice of Saruman's plans, seen in providing his services\nto help the White examine the Gladden Fields. Saruman in turn\nconsidered him Simple(minded), a Fool and can be heard saying that he is\nacting in a manner contrary to how an Istari should be.\n\nIn the films he has a eccentric personality, but is also selfless and\nbrave, as shown when healing the hedgehog Sebastian, and in holding off\nan Orc pack so that Thorin & Company could go to Rivendell. He is also\nhighly intelligent, being a Wizard, and has an adept understanding on\nhow nature works, including performing healing spells and at magical\nblasts.\n\nDespite his somewhat childish ways, Radagast is also shown to be adept\nat combat, being able to hold his own against the resurrected Witch King\nof Angmar. He is also brave, and willing to help Gandalf any way he can,\nincluding rescuing him from Dol Guldur and even giving him his staff.\n\nRadagast's fidgety and slightly hyperactive speech pattern is somewhat\nof a trademark of actor Sylvester McCoy, who has a history of playing\neccentric and comedic characters.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nIn the books, during the Council of Elrond, Gandalf refers to Radagast\nas “_master of shapes and changes of hue_”, but the meaning of this is\nopen to question. He was wiser than any man in all things concerning\nherbs and animals. It is said that he spoke many languages of birds.\n\nIn the film, Radagast is portrayed as a strange, eccentric person who\ncan communicate with animals and shows a great knowledge of herbs and\nmedicines, including being able to restore a recently deceased hedgehog\nto life. He is also shown to possess formidable combat abilities, such\nas being able to ward off an attack by the Witch-king of Angmar (or his\nsummoned shade) while investigating Dol Guldur. His preferred form of\ntransportation is a sled made of sticks and pulled by “Rhosgobel\nRabbits”. The sled is fast enough to outrun a pack of Gundabad Wargs,\nwhich were ridden by Orcs under command of Yazneg in the film.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nIt is not known when or if Radagast left Middle-earth. Tolkien writes\nthat he forsook his mission as one of the Wizards by becoming too\nobsessed with animals and plants, so presumably he failed, and might not\nbe allowed to return with honour. Tolkien also wrote that he did not\nbelieve that Radagast's failure was as great as Saruman's and that he\nmay eventually have been allowed (or chose) to return to the Undying\nLands. On the other hand, however, the primary mission of Radagast\nappointed by Yavanna may have actually been to watch over many of the\nflora and fauna of Middle-earth and to ensure their survival in the\nlikely case if Sauron conquered Middle-earth, and in this, he succeeded.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nFrom the first drafts of _The Hobbit_, Bladorthin identifies Radagast as\na fellow wizard and as his 'cousin'. John D. Rateliff notes that, at\nthis stage in the development of Tolkien's legendarium there was no\nreason why a wizard could not have a cousin. Rateliff also suggests that\nit is likely that Tolkien considered explaining Gandalf's absence\n(following the departure of Thorin and Company from Beorn's house) by\nsaying that he went to visit Radagast (who lived close by) to plan the\nattack on the Necromancer.\n\nEarly in the process of writing _The Lord of the Rings_, it is clear\nthat Tolkien envisaged some role for Radagast in the tale. He\neventually decided that he would use Radagast as the means of getting\nGandalf to Isengard.\n\nInitially Gandalf describes Radagast as his 'cousin', as he did in\n_The Hobbit_, but in a subsequent draft he becomes his 'kinsman'. In\nthe final version Gandalf merely says that Radagast is 'one of my\norder'.\n\nTolkien initially called him “Radagast the Grey”, but in pencil he\nchanged this to “Brown” and subsequently Saruman refers to him as\n“Radagast the Brown”.\n\nWhen Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on\nthe future story development; therein he considered handing over\nIsengard to Radagast.",

    "lotr_page_id": "397",
    "text": "SMAUG was a fire drake of the Third Age, considered to be the last\n“great” dragon to exist in Middle-earth. He was drawn towards the\nenormous wealth amassed by the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain during the\nreign of King Thror, and laid waste to the neighboring city of Dale and\ncaptured the Lonely Mountain, driving the surviving Dwarves into exile.\n\nFor almost two hundred years, Smaug hoarded the Lonely Mountain's\ntreasures to himself, staying within the mountain, until a company of\nDwarves managed to enter the Lonely Mountain and awaken him from\nhibernation. Correctly believing that the dwarves had received\nassistance from the men of Lake-town in entering the Lonely Mountain,\nSmaug left the mountain to wreak destruction upon Lake-town, nearly\ndecimating it before being slain by Bard the Bowman.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nDetails of his origin are unknown (presumably bred in Angband in the\nlate First Age), but in TA 2770 he attacked the Lonely Mountain and the\ntown of Dale.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nIn TA 2770, Smaug came from the mountains in the north, drawn by great\nwealth amassed by the Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain, which\nincluded gold, gemstones, silver, pearls, the many-faceted crystals of\nemerald, sapphire and diamond, and the famed Arkenstone. He took the\nmountain, killing many dwarves inside it. Thrór and Thráin used the\nsecret door to escape, and the dragon continued ravaging the surrounding\ncountryside for a long time.\n\nFor two centuries, Smaug ruled the Lonely Mountain uncontested, lying\nwithin the great treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain and ensuring that\nno one entered in an attempt to steal from him. The surrounding domain\nbecame a scarred wasteland known to the Dwarves and men as the\nDesolation of Smaug. Yet in the year TA 2941, a company of fourteen\nadventurers consisting of twelve Dwarves, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, and\nled by the heir of the Lonely Mountain, Thorin Oakenshield, entered\nSmaug's mountain lair by a secret door in a daring attempt to reclaim\nthe ancient treasure from the dragon. \n\nBilbo, the company's appointed “burglar,” was sent into the treasure\nchamber alone in an attempt to stealthily gather information and steal\nwhat he can without waking Smaug. Once inside, Bilbo was surprised to\nfind that Smaug was much larger than he had expected and covered in\nimpenetrable armor, save for his underbelly. Aware of this\nvulnerability, Smaug deliberately had spent years sprawled on the wealth\nof his hoard, allowing diamonds and hard gemstones to be embedded into\nhis belly, armoring his only weakness. However, while examining the\ndragon, Bilbo noticed a single bare patch on the monster's left breast,\nnearest his heart. With this invaluable information, he escaped the\ndragon's lair and returned to the Dwarves, sharing his discovery of\nSmaug's weakness with them, unaware that he was overheard by a thrush,\nwho carried the secret to Bard the Bowman in nearby Esgaroth, the city\nknown as “Lake-town”.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to the treasure chamber, Bilbo attempted to steal a single\ncup, but its theft is immediately noticed by Smaug, who awakens from his\nslumber. Amused by the Hobbit, Smaug converses with Bilbo, attempting to\ndeduce his origins and purpose in the mountain. He quickly surmises that\nBilbo was aiding Thorin and the rest of the Dwarf company in an attempt\nto steal back the Arkenstone and reclaim the Mountain. Smaug flies into\na rage, erupting from the mountain in a fiery wrath and loosening his\nflame upon the land. He flies to Lake-town upon the Long Lake and\ndevastates it. In the midst of the wreck, Bard the Bowman, heir to the\nthrone of Dale, does his best to rally men to repel the dragon's\nassault. Bard, guided by his knowledge of Smaug's secret weakness, fires\na black arrow into the beast's vulnerable spot on his belly. Roaring in\nfury and pain, Smaug falls from the sky and crashes into the flaming\nruins of Lake-town, his death signaled the end of the presence of\ndragons in Middle Earth. \n\nAfter Death\n\n\n\nAfter Smaug's death, Thorin and Company claimed the treasures of the\nLonely Mountain as theirs by birthright. This created a conflict with\nBard and the Elvenking Thranduil of Mirkwood, each of whom wanted a\nportion of the gold as reimbursement for all the damage Smaug had caused\nto their kingdoms over the years. Thorin refused to share the treasure\nand, as a result, they both declared war on him.\n\nIt is said that a vast fortune in gemstones lay with Smaug's rotting\ncarcass amongst the pilings of old Lake-town, but few had the courage to\ndive for them in later years. With no Dragon to contend with, the\nsurvivors of the town rebuilt on dry land next to the lake. Gandalf\nwould later note the good fortune of the dragon's destruction, as\notherwise Smaug might have proved a continual menace.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _SMAUG_ is derived from the past tense of the primitive\nGermanic verb _smugan_ (“to squeeze through a hole”). The name is\nassociated with _smeag_ (as in Smeagol), which is a form of the Old\nEnglish _smygel_ (“to burrow”).\n\nThe diphthong “au” in _Smaug_ is pronounced like the “ou” in _sound_ or\n_house_, though the name is often erroneously pronounced _Smog_, most\nnotably in the Rankin/Bass animated movie.\n\nIn Dalish, the language of Dale, the name of Smaug is _'Trāgu'_. It\nis noted to be similar with to the Norwegian word for dragon, _drágë._'\n\nOther names\n\nDuring the conversation between Smaug and Bilbo, Bilbo calls him several\nnames and epithets, such as SMAUG THE:\n\n-   '''Magnificent '''\n-   TREMENDOUS\n-   UNASSESSABLY WEALTHY\n-   MIGHTY\n-   TERRIBLE\n-   STUPENDOUS\n-   TYRANNICAL\n-   CHIEFEST AND GREATEST OF CALAMITIES\n-   YOUR MAGNIFICENCE\n\n\nSize\n\nSmaug's actual size is unknown, as it is never explicitly mentioned in\nthe _The Hobbit_. In _The Atlas of Middle-earth_ by Karen Wynn Fonstad,\nSmaug is said to be about 20 meters (66 feet) in length. This\nmeasurement corresponds with drawings by Tolkien in which Smaug seems to\nbe around 25 meters (82 feet).\n\nIt is unclear whether Smaug, the largest specimen in the Third Age,\nwould compete in mightiness to his ancestors of average size in the\nFirst Age, though he was clearly smaller than Ancalagon, the largest\nknown dragon to have existed.\n\n\nAbilities\n\n\n\nBeing a fully-grown dragon, Smaug was both massive and powerful,\npossessing physical strength capable of crushing stone with ease, as\nseen by his attack on the Lonely Mountain. He was able to fly thanks to\nhis large wings, and had the ability to breathe streams of searing hot\nflame from his mouth. Some comments in _The Hobbit_ imply that his\nentire body was imbued with fire, as he was seen to glow in the darkness\nof the Lonely Mountain's depths, and his usual paths were said to have\nbeen “smoothed and slimed” (i.e. melted) by his passage.\n\nLike many dragons of Middle-earth, Smaug's monstrous appearance also\nbelied keen senses and a dangerously sharp mind. He had an encyclopedic\nknowledge of his treasure hoard, immediately registering the theft of a\nsingle cup after Bilbo made his first visit to his lair. When the hobbit\nreturned a second time, Smaug was already expecting him by feigning\nsleep, and immediately declared that he could sense the thief even if he\ncould not see him. Although Bilbo was clever enough not to fall for\nSmaug's attempts to trick him into revealing his exact position, the\ndragon used the resulting conversation to plant doubts in Bilbo's mind,\ncorrectly guessing that the “burglar” had allied himself with the\nDwarves and the men of Lake Town and asking if Bilbo had ever considered\nthe logistical difficulties of getting his share of Smaug's treasure\nback to his home. Despite his size, Smaug is shown to be agile and\nquick, able to leap over objects with ease, and he can dive at very high\nspeeds with little effort.\n\n\n\nDefensively, Smaug's reddish-gold scales rendered him impervious to\nnearly all weapons, but his underbelly was relatively soft and\nvulnerable. To compensate for this, Smaug took to sleeping upon the\ngathered treasure of the Lonely Mountain, allowing bits of gold and\njewels to embed themselves in his body. This “diamond waistcoat” was\nintended to cover his only physical weak spot, but when Bilbo Baggins\nconfronted the dragon in his lair, he discovered a bare patch on the\nleft side of his chest. Bard was told this by an ancient thrush that\noverheard Bilbo relating this information to the Dwarves, enabling\nhim to defeat Smaug by shooting his Black Arrow into the bare patch.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nSmaug is portrayed as being psychopathic, extremely sadistic, confident,\nviolent, cruel, arrogant, intelligent and greedy, possessing an\nunquenchable desire for gold. His most distinguishing characteristic\n(aside from his greed) is his arrogance, as Smaug proudly boasts of his\nsuperiority and impregnability to Bilbo during their encounter. However,\nthis proves to be his downfall, as he unwittingly reveals the weak spot\nin his chest to Bilbo when showing the Hobbit how he had willfully\ncoated his underbelly in treasure to protect it.\n\nSmaug seems primarily motivated by personal greed rather than a desire\nto do evil, and does not seem to serve any allegiance other than his\nown. While he does ruthlessly destroy Dale and lays waste to the Dwarves\nof the Lonely Mountain during his attack on the Lonely Mountain, once he\nhas assumed dominion of the region he seems content to allow the rest of\nMiddle Earth to go about its business, so long as he or his treasure\nremains undisturbed; although this could be because he feels that the\npeople living in the region have nothing he wants. Highly intelligent,\nSmaug appears to possess a rather sardonic sense of humor, darkly\nmocking Bilbo while they converse within the Lonely Mountain's treasure\nchamber. Smaug seems to dislike Dwarves, considering them to be weak and\npathetic creatures far beneath him, making unfavorable comments\nabout Thror and showing no remorse over his slaughter of their kind and\nclaiming of their kingdom. While conversing with Bilbo, Smaug is also\nable to quickly surmise the reason for Bilbo's presence in Erebor, and\nalso correctly deduces that the Dwarves received aid from the men of\nEsgaroth in reaching the mountain.",

    "text": "CELEBORN was the_' Lord of Lothlórien_', and his wife was Galadriel,\nLady of the Golden Wood. Celeborn was said to be one of the wisest Elves\nin Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Celeborn defended Lothlórien and led the\nassault on the Enemy castle of Dol Guldur. He remained in Middle-earth\nfor a time at the beginning of the Fourth Age, but eventually he joined\nhis wife in the Undying Lands.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nCeleborn was a Prince of Doriath and a kinsman of Thingol, the King of\nDoriath. Celeborn was said to be the grandson of Thingol's brother Elmo.\nCeleborn's father was Galadhon and he had a brother named Galathil.\n\nFirst Age\n\nAround FA 52, Galadriel came to Doriath. Galadriel was one of the Ñoldor\nwho came to Middle-earth wishing to see the lands and rule a realm of\nher own. She came with the second 'group' of elves from Aman with\nFingolfin and Finrod. Celeborn and Galadriel fell in love and married\neach other.\n\nIt is not clear how long Celeborn and Galadriel dwelled in Beleriand.\nAccording to one story, they left Beleriand and crossed the Blue\nMountains into Eriador before the Fall of Nargothrond in FA 495, but\naccording to another story they remained in Beleriand until the end of\nthe First Age.\n\nAround FA 502, King Thingol of Doriath summoned dwarf craftsmen to set a\nSilmaril in Nauglamir, the fabled jeweled Necklace of the Dwarves. The\ndwarf craftsmen coveted the necklace and especially the Silmaril, and\nthey demanded that Thingol give it to them. When Thingol refused, they\nkilled him and took the necklace set with the Silmaril. The Dwarven\ncraftsmen were pursued by Elves of Doriath, who killed the Dwarves and\nretrieved the necklace. However, two Dwarves escaped and returned to\nNogrod in the Blue Mountains and rallied their kinsmen to seek vengeance\non the Elves of Doriath. An army of Dwarves attacked Doriath and\ndefeated the elves. They took the necklace once more, but Beren again\nreclaimed it.\n\nDoriath was briefly re-inhabited by Beren's son Dior Eluchíl, but the\nsons of Feanor came to try to take the Silmaril. Though Dior's daughter\nElwing escaped with the Silmaril, Dior was killed and Doriath was ruined\nand abandoned.\n\nCeleborn's distrust of Dwarves began at this time. His role in these\nevents is unknown, although in one account it is written that Celeborn\nescaped the sack of Doriath.\n\nThe First Age ended with the War of Wrath and the defeat of Morgoth.\nBeleriand was ruined and sank beneath the Sea. Many of the Ñoldor\nreturned to the Undying Lands with the pardon of the Valar, but\nGaladriel remained in Middle-earth with Celeborn.\n\nSecond Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel probably lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal\nregion west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was the High King of the\nelves who dwelled in Lindon. However, many of the elves in Harlindon -\nthe part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune - were Sindarin elves like\nCeleborn, and he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.\n\nAt some time early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to\nhave moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their\nfollowing. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their\ndaughter Celebrian may have been born during this time. They began to\nmove eastward again around the year SA 700 because Galadriel sensed a\ngrowing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.\n\nThe realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn\nare said to have dwelled there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the\nElven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of\nKhazad-dûm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not\nenter Khazad-dûm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the\ndestruction of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothlórien on\nthe other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel\nwent to dwell in Lothlórien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn\nremained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story both\nGaladriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.\n\nSauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the “Lord of gifts”\nin SA 1200 and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of\nPower under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to\nrule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three\nElven Rings of power that he had made without Sauron knowing of its\ncreation and help. Enraged, Sauron attacked Eregion in SA 1697.\n\nCeleborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's\narmy. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces\nwith Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army\nwas greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell.\nCelebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six\nof the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in\nSA 1701.\n\nThe movements of Celeborn and Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are\nunclear. Celeborn may have gone to Lothlórien to help strengthen their\ndefenses against Sauron. He and Galadriel may have lived there for a\ntime, but they did not become the rulers of Lothlórien then. The king of\nLothlórien at that time was Amdír, who was killed in the War of the Last\nAlliance at the end of the Second Age and was succeeded by his son\nAmroth.\n\nThird Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel may also have lived for a while in Rivendell, the\nhome of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal\nregion of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebrian married Elrond in TA 109.\nElrond and Celebrian had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir,\nborn in TA 130, and a daughter Arwen, born in TA 241.\n\nAround TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the\nstronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothlórien. Celeborn and\nGaladriel are said to have returned to Lothlórien to investigate the\nNecromancer and ensure the safety of Lothlórien. But after a time, they\nonce again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothlórien remained under\nthe rule of King Amroth.\n\nA Balrog awoke in Khazad-dum in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothlórien\nfled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he\nlater perished at sea. Lothlórien was left without a leader, so Celeborn\nand Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien\nin TA 1981. They ruled the realm from Caras Galadhon, the City of the\nTrees.\n\nCelebrian was on her way to Lothlórien to visit her parents in TA 2509\nwhen she was captured by orcs in Caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir\nrescued Celebrian, but the horror of the experience remained with her\nand she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the\nUndying Lands.\n\nIn TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council -\nof which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for\nthe attack and returned to Mordor. He sent Nazgûl led by Khamul to\noccupy Dol Guldur.\n\nAragorn came to Lothlórien in TA 2980 and became betrothed to Arwen, who\nwas there visiting her grandparents.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nIn December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and\nGaladriel of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring.\nThe Fellowship arrived in Lothlórien on January 15, 3019, and was\nbrought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.\n\n\n\nCeleborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and\nsaid he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once\nmore. Then he  learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an\nexpedition of Dwarves to Khazad-dum led by Balin several years before,\nand that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of\nGandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the\nFellowship to enter Lothlórien, but Galadriel soothed him and he\napologized to Gimli.\n\nCeleborn promised to help the Fellowship in any way he could. On the eve\nof the Fellowship's departure from Lothlórien, he discussed what route\nthey might take, and offered them boats to ease their journey down the\nAnduin. The next day on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a\nfeast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn gave them further\nadvice about navigating the Great River Anduin.\n\n\n\nLothlórien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War\nof the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by\nCeleborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One\nRing and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn led a force across the Anduin and\ncaptured Dol Guldur on March 28. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.\n\nOn April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, the King of the Woodland Realm, in\nMirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil\nretained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center\npart was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen. Celeborn claimed the\nsouthern part of the forest below the Narrows of the Forest to be part\nof Lothlórien. This region was named East Lórien.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas\nTirith, where she wed Aragorn on Midyear's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel\nthen travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of the King Theoden. On\nthe way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.\n\nWhen Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his\ngranddaughter's husband: _“Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other\nthan mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!”_\n\nCeleborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would\ndepart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On\nSeptember 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Gate to return\nto Lothlórien.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nGaladriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at\nthe end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothlórien, but after a\nfew years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his\ngrandsons Elladan and Elrohir for awhile in the early part of the Fourth\nAge. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the\nUndying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that “with\nhim went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.”\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _CELEBORN_ means “Silver tree”, from the Sindarin words _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _orn_ (“tree”). His original name was TELEPORNO, a\nTelerin name which means “Silver-high”, from Quenyan _tyelpe_\n(“silver”).\n\n\nPronunciation\n\nCeleborn is pronounced ‘Keleborn’ and not ‘Seleborn’.",

    "text": "ISILDUR was the oldest son of Elendil and brother to Anárion. As the\nHigh King of Gondor and Arnor, Isildur and his brother Anarion jointly\nruled Gondor in the South, while their father dwelled in the North.\n\nDuring the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur cut the One Ring from\nSauron's hand, but he refused to destroy it. Isildur was later killed by\nOrcs and the Ring was lost in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields for\nnearly 2,500 years. His refusal to destroy the Ring allowed Sauron's\nspirit to endure and ensured that he would remain a threat to\nMiddle-earth for years to come. Isildur's bloodline survived in the\nDúnedain of the North and his heirs would help end Sauron's power in the\nWar of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLife in Númenor\n\nIsildur was born in Númenor in the year SA 3209 of the Second Age. He\nhad a younger brother Anárborn in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of\nRómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their father was\nElendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of Andúnië. The\nLords of Andúnië were descended from the Kings of Númenor through\nSilmarien, the daughter of the fourth King of Númenor, Tar-Elendil.\n\nElros, the Half-elven and the first King of Númenor, had chosen the\nmortal life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the immortal life of\nElves. Over time, the Kings of Númenor grew to resent their ancestor's\nchoice and desired immortality for themselves. They became estranged\nfrom the Elves and from the powers called the Valar and they neglected\nthe worship of Eru, the one who had created them.\n\nA small group of Númenóreans remained friendly with the elves and\nfaithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among\nthese men were the Lords of Andúnië.\n\nIn SA 3262, Ar-Pharazon, the King of Númenor, took Sauron captive and\nbrought him to Númenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he\nwanted to corrupt the Númenóreans in order to bring about their\ndownfall. He used their desire for immortality and power to convince\nthem to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth.\n\nIsildur learned that Sauron wanted Ar-Pharazon to cut down Nimloth, the\nWhite Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised\nhimself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from\nNimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving\ngrave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed,\nIsildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but\nwhen the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was\nrecovered from his injuries.\n\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave\nNúmenor. They filled their ships with their families and many of their\nprized possessions, including the Palantíri. Isildur had three ships of\nhis own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree as well as\nhis wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.\n\nIsildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the\nFaithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became\nof him is not known and he was never seen again.\n\nAs Ar-Pharazon felt the approach of old age, Sauron's lies finally\nconvinced him he could achieve immortality in the Undying Lands. In SA\n3319, Ar-Pharazon set out with a great fleet intending to take the\nUndying Lands by force, but when he set foot on the shore, Ilúvatar\ncaused the Seas to open up and Valinor was hidden. The fleet sank and\nNúmenor was destroyed by a great wave.\n\nLife in Middle-earth\n\nThe ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west\nsent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north,\nwhile Isildur and Anarion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south.\nElendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both\nrealms, but he dwelt in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his\nsons.\n\nIsildur and Anárion had their thrones side by side in the Great Hall of\nOsgiliath, the city they founded on the Anduin. Anarion lived in Minas\nAnor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur made his home in\nIthilien on the eastern side of the Anduin. Isildur built Minas Ithil in\na valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor. Minas Ithil\nwas a beautiful white city, but it was also a stronghold to defend\nagainst the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at\nfirst that Sauron had already returned there in secret and had begun to\nrebuild his strength.\n\nIsildur had one of the Palantír called the Ithil-stone, which he used to\ncommunicate with his brother and father. He planted the seedling of the\nWhite Tree in front of his house. Isildur and his wife had two more sons\nwhile living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA\n3379.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the\nentrance to the Blackroot Vale in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he\nplaced the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from\nNúmenor. Isildur met with the King of the Dead, who swore allegiance to\nIsildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of\nthe Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur\ncursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled\ntheir oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.\n\nSauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in 3429. Isildur escaped with\nhis wife and sons and another seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and\nhis family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around\nthe coast of Middle-earth to Arnor, where Elendil dwelled. Elendil\nconsulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor in\nMiddle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil\nformed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430.\nThat same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of\nElrond in Rivendell.\n\nThe Last Alliance\n\nThe army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431 and\nthen marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons - Elendur,\nAratan, and Ciryon - went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their\nyoung son Valandil remained in Rivendell.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were\ndefeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the\narmy of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to\nBarad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were\nkilled, including Isildur's brother Anárion who died in SA 3440.\n\n\n\nAt last in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought\nwith Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron's body\nwas cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's\nsword broke beneath him as he fell.\n\nIsildur took up the hilt of his sword and used the broken blade to cut\nthe One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but\nas long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his\nspirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for\nhimself. Elrond and Círdan were the only two individuals who marked\nIsildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the\ncontest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil. A very\nshort time later, short enough for the heat-induced markings on the Ring\nto still be visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its\napparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he\nbelieved it would hurt forever. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled,\nseemed to shrink, and that the writing upon it's outer band seemed to be\nfading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused\nthe writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce\nthe same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that\nhe refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm\nto it.\n\nHigh King and Death\n\nIsildur assumed the Kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but he intended\nto return to the North and leave Anarion's son Meneldil to rule in the\nSouth. He remained in Minas Anor for a few years to give counsel and\ninstruction to Meneldil. Together they took a journey through all the\nlands belonging to Gondor. On the summit of Halifirien in the Firien\nwood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving\nMinas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree in memory of\nhis brother Anarion.\n\nOn September 5, TA 2, Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three\nelder sons and 200 knights. They marched up the Vales of the Anduin on\nthe eastern side of the River, heading for the High Pass over the Misty\nMountains.\n\nThirty days later, on October 4, Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs\nnear the Gladden Fields. The Orcs did not know that Isildur had the One\nRing, but they were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were\noutnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the\nattack, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were\noverwhelmed.\n\n\n\nBefore the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar\nwith the Shards of Elendil's sword. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it\nwas useless in defending his men against the Orcs. He realized now that\nhe did not have the strength to wield the Ring and could not even put it\non without great pain to himself. Isildur regretted the foolish pride\nthat had led him to keep the Ring.\n\nIsildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was\nkilled. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee in order to prevent\nthe Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great\nsorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining Dúnedain.\n\nIsildur put on the Ring though it pained him and headed for the Anduin.\nHe removed his armor and waded into the River intending to try to cross\nit. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him\ntoward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring left Isildur's\nfinger and was lost in the waters. Isildur initially felt an\noverwhelming sense of loss, but was then relieved as if a great burden\nhad been lifted from him. He rose out of the water, but at that moment,\nhe was spotted by orcs who shot him with arrows through the throat and\nheart.\n\nThe One Ring remained in the Gladden Fields until Déagol found it in TA\n2463. Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his\nkin. While searching for the One Ring, Saruman found the Elendilmir that\nIsildur had been wearing, and some speculated that the Wizard may have\nfound and even burned Isildur's remains in one of his furnaces, but\nwhether this is true is not known.\n\nIsildur's youngest son Valandil became the King of Arnor when he came of\nage in the year 10, but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and\nthe two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the\nheirs of Anarion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was\nnot until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by\nAragorn, King Elessar, Isildur's heir.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Isildur_'s name is a Quenya word that meant “Devoted to the Moon”.",

    "text": "FINGOLFIN was the second High King of the Ñoldor in Beleriand; the\nÑoldor being one of the three branches of Elves. He was the eldest son\nof Finwë and Indis, younger brother of Findis, older brother of Irimë\nand Finarfin, and the younger half-brother of Fëanor. He founded the\nHouse of Fingolfin, which ruled the Ñoldor in Middle-earth. His wife was\nAnairë and his children were Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon.\nFingolfin was said to be the strongest, most steadfast, and most valiant\nof Finwë's sons.\n\nHe had a steed named Rochallor.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLife in Valinor\n\n\n\nFingolfin was born in Tirion in Valinor during the Noontide of Valinor.\nNeither he nor his brothers were particularly close to Fëanor, as he was\nrather scornful of them. Nonetheless, he lived in peace with his kin for\nmany centuries. However, the peace of Valinor was brought to an end when\nMelkor, the most powerful of the Valar and the source of evil in Arda,\nwas released from imprisonment. Feigning repentance and rehabilitation,\nMelkor's malice had in fact only festered and grown worse while\nimprisoned, and he sought to bring ruin upon the Elves for, as he saw\nit, causing his downfall. Of the three clans of Elves in Aman, only the\nÑoldor welcomed him, as his knowledge was the greatest of any of the\nValar. Gaining their confidence, Melkor was slowly able to spread lies\nand half-truths amongst them regarding the intentions of the Valar. Over\ntime, these lies bore fruit and the Ñoldor began to openly debate\nremaining in Aman, and chief among the disgruntled Elves was Fëanor. One\nof the lies was that the sons of Indis, of which Fingolfin was the\neldest, were trying to usurp Fëanor as the rightful heir of Finwë and\nseize the Silmarils, three magnificently beautiful gems that Fëanor had\ncreated, for themselves.\n\nFëanor, already not fond of his half-siblings, had little trouble\nbelieving the rumor. Fëanor hastened to Tirion and confronted Fingolfin,\ndrawing his sword and threatening him with violence. When it became\nknown what Fëanor had done to Fingolfin, he was called by the Valar to\nexplain himself, and Melkor's lies were found out. However, Fëanor was\nheld accountable for threatening Fingolfin and was banished to the\nfortress of Formenos in the north. Around twelve years later, the two\nbrothers reconciled at a festival in Valinor (though Fëanor did so only\ngrudgingly). However, during this festival, Melkor and the monstrous\nspider Ungoliant attacked, killing the Two Trees of Valinor and\ndarkening all of Aman. They then assaulted the fortress of Formenos,\nwhere Melkor slew Finwë and stole Fëanor's Silmarils. In his pride,\ngrief, anger, and selfishness, Fëanor sought revenge upon Melkor (now\nnamed Morgoth), and attempted to convince the rest of the Ñoldor to\nassist him by convincing them that journeying to Middle-earth would\nbring them glories and treasures untold. However, many were either not\nconvinced or only half convinced, and deferred to Fingolfin, who was\nmore trusted than his brother. Fingolfin, though not particularly keen\nto leave Valinor, had sworn to Fëanor to uphold his place as the elder\nbrother, and did not want to abandon his people to the decisions of his\nrash and selfish brother. He decided to accompany Fëanor.\n\nLife in Middle-earth\n\n\n\nAs such, Fingolfin ended up becoming the leader of the second and\nlargest of the three Ñoldor hosts to leave Tirion for Middle-earth.\nFëanor led the first, and Fingolfin's brother Finarfin led the third,\nsmallest, and most reluctant host. Most of those who journeyed with him\nwere somewhat reluctant to leave, and so it took a longer time for them\nto start their journey than the host directly following Fëanor.\nUnfortunately, this delay caused Fingolfin to make a grievous mistake,\nfor not long after setting out, Fëanor attempted to seize the fleet of\nthe seafaring Teleri Elves in order to get to Middle-earth more quickly\nand safely. The Teleri resisted fiercely, and Fingolfin's host caught up\nwith Fëanor's during the middle of a heated battle. Seeing this,\nFingolfin mistakenly assumed that the Teleri had attempted to waylay the\nÑoldor, perhaps even at the request of the Valar. He and his host joined\nthe battle against the Teleri, and completed the first Elven kinslaying.\nAfter the slaughter and the theft of the ships, the Ñoldor encountered a\nfigure, possibly Mandos himself, who proclaimed a terrible Doom upon\nthem for the Kinslaying. Hearing this, and having not participated at\nall in the slaughter of the Teleri, Finarfin's host turned back and\nreturned to Tirion. The rest of the Ñoldor continued north, but as the\njourney grew more and more dangerous, many of the Ñoldor, upset about\nthe Kinslaying and having been reluctant in the first place, began to\nopenly curse Fëanor. In response, he and those most loyal to him\ndeparted one night on the Teleri ships. Upon reaching Middle-earth,\nFëanor burned the ships. The fires were spotted by Fingolfin's host, and\nthey knew that they were betrayed. Fingolfin's host's only route to\nMiddle-earth was now to cross the phenomenally dangerous ices of the\nHelcaraxë or to return to Tirion in disgrace and suffer the punishment\nof the Valar for their role in the Kinslaying. But Fingolfin wished to\ncontinue to Middle-earth, in no small part to confront the brother for\nhis utter betrayal. Fingolfin's host chose to cross the Helcaraxë, but\nlost many of its members along the way, greatly increasing the wrath and\nbitterness that Fingolfin and his host felt for Fëanor's host. The host\nof Fingolfin finally arrived in Middle-earth at the rising of the Sun\n(FA 1) and was assailed by an Orc army in Lammoth resulting in the death\nof Fingolfin's youngest child. Destroying the Orc host, Fingolfin and\nhis army approached the doors of Angband, Morgoth's great fortress and\nsmote upon them, but Morgoth and his servants, dismayed by the light of\nthe new Sun, stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Ñoldor then came to\nthe northern shores of Lake Mithrim (FA 2), from which the Fëanorian\npart of the host had withdrawn.\n\nWith virtually all of Fingolfin's host furious over Fëanor's betrayal, a\ncivil war would have broken out amongst the Ñoldor had it not been for\nthe actions of Fingolfin's son Fingon. After the initial confrontation\nof Fëanor's host against Morgoth's forces, the Elves had defeated their\nfoes with relative ease, but Fëanor in his pride and wrath had thought\nto come upon Morgoth himself, and had pursued the remnants of Morgoth's\narmy with only a small vanguard. Upon reaching Angband, this vanguard\nencountered a few Balrogs and had quickly been slain, with Fëanor\nfalling at the hands of Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs. After this,\nMorgoth had sent a false claim of parley to the new leader of Fëanor's\nhost; his eldest son Maedhros. Expecting treachery, both sides sent\ngreater force than agreed upon to the negotiation site, but Morgoth's\nhad been accompanied by Balrogs, who slew the Elven company in short\norder and captured Maedhros. After failing to gain concessions from the\nElves by offering to release Maedhros, Morgoth chained Maedrhos to a\ncliff by one hand and left him there. Fingon quickly learned of this\nand, having been a great friend of Maedhros before Fëanor's divisive\nactions, he sought to rescue his friend. Succeeding, both returned to\nthe gathered Ñoldor, who were amazed at Fingon's actions. Seeking to\nkeep his people united, Maedhros waived all claim to kingship, and\nFingolfin thus became High King of the Ñoldor (FA 7). They were quickly\nable to establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand, and subsequent attacks\nby Morgoth against them were repelled completely and with relative ease.\nFingolfin established the Siege of Angband after the complete victory of\nDagor Aglareb, and ruled in peace and prosperity from Hithlum, by the\nnorthern shores of Lake Mithrim. On FA 20, he hosted the famous feast of\nMereth Aderthad in Eithel Ivrin, which was attended by emissaries from\nall the Elves in Beleriand. There Fingolfin retained close counsel\nand friendship with Maedhros. \n\nCombat with Morgoth and death\n\nThough the Elves were able to contain Morgoth's Orcs, they did not\npossess the strength to attack Angband directly or actually overthrow\nMorgoth. Morgoth himself was not idle during the four hundred years of\nthe siege, and he spent the time increasing the strength of his forces\nand creating new, deadlier creatures than Orcs for his armies. After\nreaching what he believed to be sufficient levels of soldiers, Morgoth's\narmies burst into Beleriand in the Dagor Bragollach. Accompanied by\nmassive volcanic eruptions, the Orcs, Balrogs, and the dragon Glaurung\ncompletely overran the Elven defenses surrounding Angband, driving far\ninto the south of Beleriand and slaughtering untold numbers of Elves.\nFingolfin's kingdom in Hithlum managed barely to defend itself, as the\nmountains surrounding it provided protection against the flame and magma\nMorgoth had caused to spew from the Iron Mountains around Angband. But\nmost of the other kingdoms of the Ñoldor were destroyed. The apparent\ntotality of the defeat caused a great wrath and despair to overcome\nFingolfin, and he resolved to go to Angband and challenge Morgoth\nhimself to single combat. He mounted his horse and proceeded to ride\nacross Anfauglith with such wrath that it was said that those who saw\nhim mistook him for the Vala Oromë. He rode to Angband, unhindered by\nany of Morgoth's servants, smote upon the gates of Angband and shouted\nhis challenge for all to hear, mocking Morgoth. Morgoth, though still\nsaid to be the “mightiest of all things in this world”, was reluctant to\nface Fingolfin, because despite his might, he alone of the Valar knew\nfear. But Fingolfin's insults could not be ignored without Morgoth\nlosing face before his captains. As such, he donned black armor, took up\na great mace, and emerged from Angband. Fingolfin drew his sword,\nRingil, and the duel began. Many times Morgoth attempted to smite\nFingolfin, but the Elven King managed to dodge all of Morgoth's blows,\nand wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But after a time, Fingolfin grew\nweary, and Morgoth beat him to the ground three times. Fingolfin rose up\nand continued to fight each time, but as Mandos had foretold, no power\nof the Elves could defeat Morgoth, a Vala. Eventually, Fingolfin\nstumbled backwards into one of the many pits carved by Morgoth's failed\nstrikes, and Morgoth stepped on the Elven King's neck and killed him.\nHowever, Fingolfin's last, desperate stroke managed to cut into\nMorgoth's heel.\n\nAfter defeating him, Morgoth took Fingolfin's body and broke it,\nintending to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of Eagles,\nswooped down upon Morgoth and with his talons slashed at Morgoth's face.\nAs Morgoth reeled from this new assault, Thorondor retrieved Fingolfin's\nbody and brought it to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin. Turgon built\na cairn over the remains of his father, and Fingon, in sorrow, became\nHigh King of the Ñoldor. After Fingolfin's defeat, though he had been\ndefeated by Morgoth, the Orcs never made any type of boastful song to\ncelebrate, nor did the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow was far too\ngreat. Morgoth walked with a limp after the duel, and the wounds he\nreceived pained him forever.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nFingolfin's father-name was ÑOLOFINWË “High Finwë”, from the Quenyan\n_ngolod_ (“wise”). His mother-name is ARAKÁNO “High Chieftain”, from\n_ara_ (“high”) and _káno_ (“chieftain”). The name _Fingolfin_ is\nthe Sindarin form of his name.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nFingolfin had another son, Argon, who was not mentioned in the published\n_The Silmarillion_. Argon is only mentioned in _The History of\nMiddle-earth_, in which it is told that he fought and died during the\nBattle of the Lammoth.",

    "text": "TÚRIN TURAMBAR was an Adan of the House of Hador and a Man of\nMiddle-earth, who became a tragic hero (or anti-hero) of the First Age,\nin the tale called _Narn i Chîn Húrin_ (“The Tale of the Children of\nHúrin”).\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nTúrin was the only son of Húrin Thalion and Morwen Eledhwen. He had a\nyounger sister Urwen, whom everyone called “Lalaith” because of her\nlaughter. However, she died in childhood of plague. After Húrin was\ncaptured in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Túrin remained with his mother\nMorwen, who hid him from the Easterlings that Morgoth had sent to\nHithlum, fearing they would kill Túrin or enslave him. Unknown to Túrin\nat that time, Morgoth had placed a curse on all of Húrin's family.\n\nHis life in Doriath\n\n\n\nWhen Túrin was eight years old Morwen sent him to Doriath, where he was\nadopted by Thingol as a son. After this Túrin's second sister, Nienor\nwas born. Túrin was restless, and as soon as he was permitted he joined\nBeleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the orcs of Morgoth.\nHe wore the _Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin_, and the orcs feared him above\nall others.\n\nLife as an Outlaw\n\nTúrin accidentally caused the death of Saeros, one of Thingol's\ncounselors who provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either\npunished or forgiven, he fled, eventually encountering a band of outlaws\nthat dwelt south of Brethil. There he identified himself only as NEITHAN\n(_the wronged_). Túrin killed their leader, and became their leader in\nhis place. During his rule, he stopped the outlaws from raiding houses\nof free folk, and only hunted Orcs.\n\nIn the meantime, Beleg Cúthalion obtained leave by Thingol to seek out\nhis friend. In FA 487, Beleg found Túrin's outlaws at the outskirts of\nAmon Rûdh and was held tied up in question by them until Túrin returned;\nwhen Beleg could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left\nto return to Doriath. Túrin's band later captured Mîm the Petty-dwarf\nwhile Beleg and Túrin were parted. Mîm was forced to share his halls on\nAmon Rûdh with his company while Túrin promised to repay Mîm for the\naccidental death of his son Khîm.\n\nDeath of Beleg\n\nAt Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed\nthis and also gave him the sword Anglachel, and Thingol's wife Melian\ngave him Lembas. Beleg returned to Túrin that winter, healing those of\nthe band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the\nDragon-helm, after Turin agreed to take the Dragon-helm, the area around\nAmon Rûdh became known as Dor-Cúarthol, “The Land of Bow and Helm”\n(since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). There Túrin took the name\nGORTHOL, \"_The Dread Helm\"_. Many warriors joined them, and much of the\nWest of Beleriand was freed from evil for a while.\n\nEventually, Túrin was betrayed by Mîm the dwarf. He was captured at the\ntop of Amon Rûdh and all his men were slain about him. Beleg survived\nand rescued Túrin from the orcs in Taur-nu-Fuin with the help of\nGwindor, an escaped slave of Morgoth, but Túrin accidentally killed\nBeleg with Beleg's sword Anglachel. Beleg , who was trying to cut Túrins\nbonds, was mistaken by Túrin as one of the orcs tormenting him. Thus, he\nroared in fear and killed Beleg and awoke the camp, Gwindor and Túrin\nthen fled. Gwindor led Túrin whose mind was lost in a silent sadness, to\nthe Pools of Ivrin, where he then cried and his madness was cured.\n\nLeader of Nargothrond\n\n\n\nGwindor then led Túrin to Nargothrond, where once he had lived. In\nNargothrond, Túrin hid his name, calling himself by the alias AGARWAEN\nSON OF ÚMARTH (Sindarin for \"_Bloodstained son of Ill-fate\"_), while\nhopeing to hide his identity and escape Morgoth's curse upon his kin. He\nhad Anglachel reforged and named it _Gurthang_, \"_Iron of Death\"_.\nFinduilas, daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided\nher because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor.\nTúrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him THURIN (_the\nsecret_). He was also called ADANEDHEL (_Man-Elf_) because he was so\nlike an elf, though he was human. Gwindor later revealed Túrin's true\nidentity to Finduilas when anger and sadness over took him and it\neventually reached Finduilas' father, King Orodreth.\n\nThe revelation of his identity resulted in Túrin becoming a chief\ncounsellor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He\nencouraged the Nargothrondrim to abandon their practice of secrecy, and\nthey built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with\nGurthang, he himself became known as the MORMEGIL (_Black Sword_), or\nthe BLACK SWORD OF NARGOTHROND. In FA 495, with Orodreth now deep in the\ncouncil of Túrin, the Elves of Nargothrond marched out from their secret\ncity with an army of some thousands of elves to confront the enemy\nmassing beneath the Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow) and in the Pass\nof Sirion. They were overwhelmed and driven into the Plain of Tumhalad\nand utterly defeated in the Battle of Tumhalad. Only Túrin, who wore the\nDragon Helm of Dor-lómin was able to survive the hot fiery blasts of\nGlaurung and escaped. There was a desperate attempt to destroy the\nbridge Túrin has ordered to be built for swifter actions of the army,\nalas it was too well made and the enemy arrived and Glaurung the father\nof dragons destroyed the gate and the sacking of the once mighty\nNargothrond, began.\n\nThe Dragon's Deceit\n\n\n\nTúrin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung at the smashed gate of\nthe city, and stood by idly as Finduilas and hundreds of captives was\ndragged away, Finduilas called to him, once her cries were drowed out in\nthe distance Túrin was released from Glaurung's spell of which deceived\nTúrin into believing Morwen and Nienor were suffering in Dor-lómin, and\nTúrin abandoned Finduilas to seek out his kin. In actuality, Morwen and\nNienor were safely in Doriath, as Túrin's own efforts had made the way\npassable.\n\nOnce in Dor-lómin, Túrin found his old home empty. He went to the halls\nof the Easterling lord Brodda, who had taken Húrin's kinswoman Aerin as\na wife and many a time beaten her and enslaved Túrin's people, Brodda\nhad also taken Húrin's lands and possessions to which also rightfully\nbelonged to Túrin. From Aerin, Túrin learned that Morwen had left, and\nin his rage, he held Brodda up like a dog and threw him in a group of\nmen breaking his neck killing Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate.\nAs Túrin left again, Aerin burnt herself alive in Brodda's halls, and\nthe remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even with more\ncruelly.\n\nTúrin next tried to find Finduilas, but by the time he picked up the\nOrc's trail he came too late: the woodsmen of Brethil informed him she\nhad been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of\nNargothrond. Túrin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was\nbrought to Brethil.\n\nIn Brethil Túrin again took up his life, now calling himself TURAMBAR\n(Master of Doom) in an act of bravado, deciding that his curse was now\nfinally over. One night in the middle of a fierce storm he and his men\nfound a naked young woman on Finduilas's grave, and called her Níniel \"\nMaiden of tears\" for she cried for she knew nothing. Túrin years later\ntook her as his wife. Túrin did not know that this was indeed his\nsister, whose memory had been erased by Glaurung. Brandir, out of\njealousy or forecast, told Niniel that a shadow was cast above Túrin,\nand that instead of being Master of Shadow, the Shadow would inevitably\nmaster him.\n\nSlayer of Glaurung\n\n\n\nTúrin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil, burning miles\nand miles of forest so that he could reach where the woodsmen lived.\nTúrin with two others set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only\none to reach the drake. Dorlas, being too cowardly, abandoned Túrin, but\nHunthor the faithful went on. As Túrin passed underneath the dragon, he\nnearly toppled into the waters due to the dragon's stench had it not\nbeen for Hunthor, who steadied him. Unfortunately as a result of this\naction a stone moved by Glaurang's passing hit Hunthor on the head, and\nhe fell into the ravine. With his black sword and bitterness in his\nheart, Túrin then stabbed the dragon's belly with all his hatred and\npower; killing Glaurung at Cabed-en-Aras, but was hurt and fell in a\nswoon. As Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words\nrevealed to her she was his sister. Horrified, Nienor Níniel killed\nherself by leaping into the ravines of the river.\n\nDeath\n\n\n\nWhen Túrin awoke he was told by Brandir the Lame, lord of the Haladin of\nBrethil what had happened, he killed Brandir in anger in front of many\npeople, refusing to believe the truth. When he learned from Mablung of\nDoriath who had come to seek him that Brandir was telling truth and that\nhe had wrongfully slew him, he could no longer live with the pains and\nmisfortunes of his life and decided to take his life. Just before his\ndeath, he revealed that he had been 'blind'; Morgoth's curse had him\ngroping in the dark since childhood.\n\nThen, Turin said to Gurthang: _“Hail Gurthang, iron of death, thou alone\nnow remainest! But what lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand\nthat wieldeth thee? From no blood wilt thou shrink! Wilt thou take Tùrin\nTurambar? Wilt thou slay me swiftly?”_\n\n\n\nAnd from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: _“Yea, I will drink thy\nblood, that may I forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of\nBrandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly.”_ Then Tùrin set the\nhilts upon the ground, and cast himself upon the point of Gurthang, and\nthe black blade took his life. Túrin and several of the others connected\nto his story are some of the few people in the Middle-earth legendarium\nto have committed suicide.\n\nAn alternate interpretation of Túrin's revelation mirrors that of his\nfather's in the Silmarillion, that all that he had seen was twisted by\nthe malice and might of Morgoth, and so as if blind, he stumbled through\nlife.\n\nTúrin was buried near Finduilas' grave, in a high mound where he had\nfallen, and the shards of Gurthang were set beside him.\n\n'And thereon the Elves carved in the Runes of Doriath: TÚRIN TURAMBAR\nDAGNIR GLAURUNGA\n(_Túrin, Master of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung_).\n\nand beneath they wrote also:\n\nNIËNOR NÍNIEL\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter Húrin, Túrin's father, was released from Angband, he and his wife\nMorwen met at the gravesite of their children for the first and last\ntime, and Morwen died when the sun set holding Húrin's hand and was also\nburied there. The mound they were buried beneath survived the War of\nWrath and Tol Morwen was the westernmost isle off the coast of Lindon in\nthe Second and Third Ages.\n\nWhether the tragedies in Túrin's life were the result of Morgoth's curse\nor of his own arrogance, or some combination of the two, are a subject\nof some debate among fans and scholars.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nThe second prophecy of Mandos (later removed from the Silmarillion by\nChristopher Tolkien) states that at the End of Time Morgoth would wage a\nfinal battle against the Valar, the Final Battle, and that Túrin\nTurambar reincarnated would plunge Gurthang into Morgoth's heart and\ndefeat him once and for all, exterminating evil forever, and avenging\nthe Children of Húrin.\n\nThe supposed resemblance of Túrin to figures from medieval tales can be\nconfirmed by part of a letter Tolkien wrote to Milton Waldman, a\npublisher, concerning the publication of his works.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _TÚRIN_ means “he who desires mastery”, from the Sindarin words\n_tûr_ (“power, mastery, lord”) and _ind_ (desire, heart“). In Quenya,\nhis name becomes TURINDO, from _tur_ (”master“) and _indo_ (”mood\").\n\nTURAMBAR means “Master of Doom”, from the Quenya _tur_ (“master”) and\n_ambar_ (“doom”).\n\nOther names\n\n-   Adanedhel, “Man-Elf”\n-   Agarwaen, son of Úmarth, “Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate”\n-   Gorthol, “The Dread Helm”\n-   Mormegil, “Black Sword”\n-   Neithan, “The Wronged”\n-   Thurin, “The Secret”.",

He was the Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien and Captain of\nthe White Tower upon his brother's death.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Faramir became the first Prince of Ithilien\nand married Éowyn of Rohan.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\nFaramir was born in the year TA 2983 to Denethor II and Finduilas,\ndaughter of Adrahil of Dol Amroth. The following year, his\ngrandfather Ecthelion II died and his father, Denethor, succeeded him as\nthe Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nWhen Faramir was five years old, Finduilas died. Her death caused\nDenethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between\nFaramir and Boromir, who was five years elder of the brothers, grew much\ncloser and greater in love. Despite the obvious way that Denethor\nfavored Boromir over Faramir, there was no jealousy or rivalry between\nthem. Boromir protected and helped him, and Faramir looked up to his\nolder brother. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance\nwith their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality.\nBoromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more\nfearless and strong warrior. Faramir’s boldness was incorrectly judged\nless due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music.\n\nIt was this interest that formed a friendship between Faramir and\nGandalf the Grey. The youngest son of Denethor learned of what he could\nfrom Gandalf’s wisdom and mentoring. Denethor did not approve of Faramir\nas the “Wizard's pupil”, for he neither trusted nor liked the Istar.\n\nFaramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved\nto be handy on the battlefield. During the War of the Ring, he was the\nCaptain of the Rangers of Ithilien, who often skirmished with the allies\nof Sauron in that province. Faramir valiantly defended Gondor from the\nEnemy, but did not enjoy fighting for war’s sake.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nIn June of 3018, Sauron's forces attacked Osgiliath, under the command\nof the Witch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to draw back\nacross the Anduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, in which\nBoromir’s and Faramir's companies remained, the two brothers, along with\ntwo others, swam to shore and managed to hold all of the west shores of\nthe Anduin.\n\nThe night before the assault, Faramir had a prophetic dream of a voice\nspeaking the following riddle:\n\n ‟Seek for the Sword that was broken: In Imladris it dwells; There shall\nbe counsels taken Stronger than Morgul-spells. There shall be shown a\ntoken That Doom is near at hand, For Isildur's Bane shall waken, And the\nHalfling forth shall stand”\n\n    —Faramir's dream\n\nIt came to Faramir twice more and once to his brother, and the brothers\ntold of their dream to Denethor, who only told them that Imladris was an\nElvish name for Rivendell, home of Elrond the Half-elven. Although\nFaramir had wanted to go for Gondor’s sake and was originally chosen by\nthe Council of Elders in Gondor, Boromir, with the urging of his father,\nstepped forward and claimed the right to the errand, deeming it to be\ndangerous and doubtful. The Gondorian traveled nearly four months to\nRivendell, losing his horse in the process, and arriving just before the\nCouncil of Elrond.\n\nOn February 29, 3019 at midnight, Faramir, who was on guard duty on the\nwestern shore in Osgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the\nAnduin River. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother,\nwhich was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but\nthere was no sign of the Great Horn, which he and his father had heard\nbeing blown far across the distance in the North three days prior.\n\n\n\nDuring a battle with Southrons, Faramir, who took over his brother's\nposition as the Captain of the White Tower, encountered the Hobbits\nFrodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, recognizing them to be the Halflings\nhis dream spoke of. After the skirmish, Faramir took the pair to Henneth\nAnnûn and questioned them further.\n\nThrough intelligent questioning and intuition, Faramir determined that\nFrodo was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy.\nAt this point, he showed the crucial difference between him and his\nproud brother:\n\nSam accidentally revealed Boromir's desire for the Enemy’s Ring,\nIsildur's Bane. Despite the hobbits’ fears, Faramir remained true to his\nvow that he would not take it even if it lay on the highway, for he was\nwise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good.\nWith this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had\nfaced.\n\nOn the very same night, Gollum was spotted fishing in the Forbidden Pool\nnext to Henneth Annûn -- an act punishable by death. Faramir listened to\nFrodo’s pleads to spare Gollum’s life though, and after interrogating\nthe creature he deemed that Frodo and Sam would be free in the Lands of\nGondor and Gollum under Frodo's protection. Giving them provisions, he\nsent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting,\nFaramir warned Frodo of Gollum's treacherous nature and that the path\nGollum had proposed (Cirith Ungol) had an evil reputation of old.\n\n\n\nFaramir and his company retreated to Cair Andros, an island in the River\nAnduin that guarded the northern approaches to Minas Tirith. After\nnoting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, Faramir sent\nhis company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath while he and\nthree others of his men rode to Minas Tirith directly. Along the way,\nthey were pursued by the Nazgûl, riding fell beasts. The men, except\nFaramir, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts\nand men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen.\nIf Gandalf had not intervened, they would have surely perished.\n\n\n\nArriving at Minas Tirith, Faramir reported to Denethor and Gandalf of\nhis encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had\nnot brought the ring to Gondor, wishing that he and his brother’s places\nwere reversed, since Denethor believed that Boromir would bring the\nEnemy’s weapon to him.\n\nDenethor sent his remaining son to hold Western Osgiliath against the\nhosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although Faramir\ndisagreed with his father’s strategy, he agreed to go.\n\nThe Witch-king overwhelmed the men of Gondor and won Osgiliath. Faramir\ndrew back to the Causeway Forts, in which many of the men were wounded\nor killed. Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make\nsure that the retreat over Pelennor Fields would not turn into a\ndisaster.\n\nFaramir was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow during the retreat.\nFortunately, Gandalf and Faramir’s uncle, Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth,\nrode to the aid of Faramir and the troops with hosts of cavalry. Imrahil\nbore Faramir back to Denethor, telling him that his son had done great\ndeeds.\n\nRegretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril\nwithout his blessing, Denethor, after looking in the Palantir, believing\nthat the Ring was captured and the end was near, ordered his servants to\nbuild a funeral pyre for him and his son, who was believed to be\npoisoned by the Witch-king’s dart. Despite the protests of the Hobbit,\nPippin Took (serving the steward in payment of Boromir's death) that\nFaramir was still alive, Denethor continued with this madness and\nreleased him from his service.\n\nHorrified, Pippin went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower\nGuards. Beregond, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and\nrisk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the\npyre. Pippin returned with Gandalf, who intervened by taking Faramir off\nthe pyre as Faramir moaned out to his father in his dreams. Denethor\ntook out a knife, trying to take Faramir back, but Beregond placed\nhimself in front of Faramir. Seeing that he could not win, Denethor lit\nthe pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.\n\n\n\nThen, Faramir was laid in the Houses of Healing until Aragorn came and\nrevived Faramir with _athelas_. It was not a poisoned dart of the\nWitch-king that wounded him in a state near death as it was with\nSnowmane, but the arrow of a Haradrim, along with Faramir’s weariness\nand grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his\nfather and the Black Breath of the Nazgul, who, under Sauron's orders,\nhunted Faramir ever since he had left Ithilien. When he awoke, Faramir\nimmediately recognized Aragorn as his rightful King, therefore realizing\nthat no proof was needed after all.\n\nBefore Aragorn left to lead the soldiers to the Black gate, he commanded\nthe Warden of the Houses of Healing to have Faramir and Éowyn to remain\nresting for at least ten days. After Éowyn demanded that the Warden take\nher to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride\nout in battle, Faramir, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by\nher beauty, told Éowyn that he too, had to heed the advice of the\nWarden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to Mordor\nand asked her to talk with him at times.\n\nFaramir and Éowyn walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and\nhe learned from Merry Brandybuck of Éowyn's despair of feeling trapped,\nwaiting on the waning of Théoden, and Aragorn's rejection of Éowyn's\nlove.\n\nOn March 25, Faramir gave Éowyn a dark blue mantle sewn with silver\nstars that had once belonged to his mother, as they stood at the wall\nthat looked towards Mordor. There, they saw a threatening darkness\ntowering over and seeing this, Faramir told her of his dream of the\nDownfall of Númenor that the darkness threatening to overtake\nMiddle-earth reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the land of\nNúmenor. Somehow, to Faramir and the people of the city, a hope and joy\nwelled in their hearts and he kissed Éowyn’s brow.\n\n\n\nÉowyn, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days\nafter he’d given her the mantle, Faramir told her that he understood\nthat she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had\nfelt trapped in, and when Aragorn only gave her understanding and pity,\ninstead of love (which she later realized was a shadow of love), she had\nwanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that\nthough he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, Éowyn’s grief\nwas fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and\nrealized that she had come to love Faramir in return.\n\nLater Years\n\nFaramir briefly served as the Ruling Steward of Gondor, and began\npreparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King’s\nofficial coronation on May 1st, Faramir surrendered his office, which\nwas represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so.\nAragorn however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line\nwould last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor.\nAfter Faramir had asked the people of Gondor if they accepted Aragorn as\ntheir King (which they did), Faramir took the crown out and Aragorn was\ncrowned King Elessar.\n\nKing Elessar appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond\nto be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of\nIthilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth, Gondor's two highest-ranking\nnobles, became King Elessar's chief commanders. His duties also included\nacting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost,\nrehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws\nand orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul of evil-remnants. Faramir also\nfulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief\ncounselor as well as ruling Gondor in the King's absence.\n\n\n\nAfter marrying Éowyn, the two settled in Emyn Arnen, where they had\nat least one son (named Elboron), who succeeded him as Steward of\nGondor, Prince of Ithilien, and Lord of Emyn Arnen, after Faramir's\ndeath in FO 82. Faramir lived to be 120 years old, due to the large\npercentage of pure Dúnedain ancestry he possessed as a member of the\nGondorian nobility. One of his descendants was Barahir, who may have\nbeen the son of Elboron.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAs with the other names of the Kings of Gondor and their heirs, it\nis possible that the name Faramir could be Quenya.",

    "text": "SARUMAN (Quenya; IPA:  - “Man Of Skill”), also known as\nSARUMAN THE WHITE was an _Istar_ (wizard), who lived in Middle-earth\nduring the Third Age. Originally, he was the chief of the wizards and of\nthe White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark\nmagic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring for himself.\nThinking he could ally himself with Sauron and then betray him, Saruman\nallied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was\ndefeated.\n\nHe studied deeply the arts of Sauron, the better to oppose him, but he\nsoon became enamored of Sauron's devices, especially the One Ring. He\nbetrayed his mission and sought the power of the Ring for himself. He\ninitially advocated an alliance with Sauron, but he soon betrayed Sauron\nas well, as his ultimate goal was to supplant Sauron and rule\nMiddle-earth. But his plans came to nought, and his power was broken in\nthe Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.\n\nBefore his fall, he was the chief of both the wizards and of the White\nCouncil (a league of all those opposed to Sauron). His knowledge and\nskill, especially of Sauron's devices, was said to be great. However,\nhis deep study of the One Ring and Sauron's other magic corrupted him,\nand his overweening lust for power led to his downfall. He is one of the\nfew characters in Middle-earth who is morally “grey” - serving neither\ngood nor evil. He betrays both sides and ultimately works for his own\nends.\n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n Saruman was\noriginally a Maia of Aulë the Smith - just as Sauron had once been -\nnamed CURUMO, meaning “skillful one”, or CURUNÍR by the elves in\nSindarin. In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by\nManwë, leader of the Valar, shortly after Sauron's defeat by the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men. Though Sauron was overthrown, it would later\nturn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his shadow\nbegan to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send\nfive emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be “mighty, peers of\nSauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,” as they were\nintended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards\nwere forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.\n\nThe other four who were chosen were Olórin (Gandalf), Aiwendil\n(Radagast), and Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo was\nappointed overall leader of the group. {{-}}\n\nArrival in Middle-earth\n\nThe five wizards arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador\naround the year 1000. Only the keeper of the havens, Círdan the\nShipwright, knew Saruman's identity and origin. Saruman would later\ndiscover that Círdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Gandalf upon\ntheir first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Saruman was immediately\nconsidered the head of the order while Gandalf was not, Círdan had\ndivined Gandalf as the wisest and greatest of the wizards. Saruman's\njealousy of Gandalf grew from these events, perhaps because he feared\nthat he would eventually supplant him as chief of wizards.\n\nSaruman and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth.\nAfter one and a half millennia, he returned to the west, just as\nSauron's power was growing again in Dol Guldur.\n\nThe White Council\n\nWhen the White Council was formed at approximately year 2463 of the\nThird Age in order to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader,\nthough Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Saruman refused to\nstep down due to his pride, while Gandalf had declined. At this point\nSaruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and\ndesire his power, and especially the One Ring. This was also the same\nyear that the One Ring was taken by the Halfling Sméagol (later called\nGollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds\nof years. It was during the meetings of the Council that Saruman first\nnoted Gandalf's interest in Hobbits and The Shire, and believing that\nall his deeds related to some as yet undisclosed plan of his for\nself-enhancement, Saruman himself began keeping a greater watch on\nGandalf and sent spies to The Shire. At first, he himself visited it\nsecretly but stopped when he realized that its inhabitants had noticed\nhim. Amongst the purposes of his visits was to procure some of the\nhalflings' Pipe-weed, since in secret imitation of Gandalf he had begun\nto smoke.\n\nAt Isengard\n\n\n\nIn the year TA 2759, Saruman settled in Isengard with the permission of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Beren, although he settled only as Warden of the\nTower and representative of the Steward (the stronghold had by then been\nabandoned by Gondor). There he became important in the informal alliance\ndefending the west of Middle-earth. In the tower of Isengard, Orthanc,\nhe also found one of the remaining Palantíri.\n\nIn TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil\npresence was indeed Sauron. By Saruman's advice, the White Council\ndecided against attacking Dol Guldur. Gandalf would later remark that it\nwas at this council meeting that he first began to suspect that Saruman\ndesired to possess the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to permit\nSauron to build up his strength, so that the One Ring would reveal\nitself. He later found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible\nlocation of the One Ring than he expected, and in TA 2941, he finally\nagreed to attack Dol Guldur.\n\nTen years after, Sauron abandoned Dol Guldur he returned to Mordor and\ndeclared himself openly. He established contact with Saruman through the\nPalantír captured from Minas Ithil, now Minas Morgul. In this year,\nSaruman also took Isengard for his own and began to fortify it.\n\nWhen Gandalf presented Saruman with the discovery and the location of\nthe One Ring, Saruman revealed his desire for it and his secret alliance\nwith Sauron. He had also shed the title of Saruman the White; Saruman no\nlonger had any loyalty to the White Council, or the Ring-bearer. He\ntried unsuccessfully to gain Gandalf's allegiance. When Gandalf refused\nto join with him, Saruman held him captive in Isengard. Gandalf later\nescaped with help from Gwaihir the Windlord, one of Middle-earth's large\nEagles, and made Saruman's treachery known to the rest of the White\nCouncil.\n\nThe Beginning of the End\n\n\n\nBy one account, the Nazgûl came two days after Gandalf's escape and\nSaruman used his Voice to persuade the Lord of the Nazgûl that he did\nnot know the Ring's location but that Gandalf did and they should seek\nhim nearby. After the Nazgûl heard this they went back on the main road\nrode along and instead found Gríma Wormtongue (who went to tell Saruman\nthat Gandalf had been to Edoras) who revealed that Saruman was hiding\nhis knowledge of the Shire from them. By another account, Saruman only\ndiscovered that Gandalf had escaped when the Nazgûl arrived, he has\nbeen, according to this account, about to beg Gandalf for forgiveness\nand help, only to find him gone. He pretended that Gandalf was still\nthere and had just told him the location of the Shire.\n\nThe Nazgûl later learned that Saruman knew far more than he had\nrevealed. On their way to the Shire, the Nazgûl met one of Saruman's\nShire spies, from whom they got detailed maps of the Shire made by\nSaruman. They sent the spy back to the Shire after warning him that he\nwas now in the service of Mordor (the Orc-like man in the Inn of the\nPrancing Pony).\n\nBelieving that he would find no pity from either quarter (a false\nassumption, since he was later offered pardon by Gandalf); Saruman now\nput all efforts into obtaining the One Ring for himself. Not all of\nthese efforts ever became known, but they included sending spies to\nwaylay Frodo Baggins on his flight from the Shire (Bill Ferny in Bree),\nattacking Rohan outright with Uruk-hai, and dispatching raiding parties\nof Uruk-hai accompanied by Moria Orcs on likely routes the Fellowship of\nthe Ring might take through Rohan to go towards Gondor. One of those\nparties captured Pippin and Merry and shot Boromir “with many\nblack-feathered arrows” when he tried to defend the Hobbits. This led\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on a search which eventually led to the\nBattle of Helms Deep as well as the Destruction of Isengard by the Ents\nunder Treebeard, leading to the end of Saruman's reign of power in the\nnorth.\n\nPower Destroyed\n\n\n\nSaruman's plans failed, and he suffered a series of setbacks. Saruman's\nShire network did not capture Frodo Baggins, and Éomer destroyed his\nonly partially successful raiding party. His invasion of Rohan ended in\ndisaster with the utter defeat of his army at the Battle of the\nHornburg. Leaving Isengard undefended resulted in its destruction at the\nhands of the Ents (Saruman had underestimated the Ents' anger and\nstrength).\n\nConfined to the Orthanc and with his servants scattered or killed,\nSaruman made one final unsuccessful attempt to turn Théoden and Gandalf\nover to evil. The latter then offered Saruman a chance for redemption,\nwhich involved surrendering his staff and the Keys of Orthanc as a\npledge. Saruman had a moment of doubt but in the end pride, anger, and\nhate won over and he refused the chance of redemption.\n\n\n\nGandalf, who had returned from death to supplant Saruman, as the White\nand the head of the Wizard, expelled Saruman from the order and broke\nhis staff. Saruman also lost the Palantír of Orthanc when Gríma\nWormtongue threw it off a balcony of Orthanc, undecided about which he\nhated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither.\n\n\nFinal Fall\n\nLeft out of the final stages of the War of the Ring, Saruman eventually\nmanaged to persuade the Ents who kept him captive into letting him leave\nIsengard after he met the conditions of handing over the Keys of\nOrthanc. He then went to the Shire, which his agent Lotho\nSackville-Baggins had brought under control. He spent his final days as\na small-time criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the\nOrkish _sharkû,_ meaning “old man”), until he was overthrown in the\nBattle of Bywater. In the aftermath of that battle Frodo confronted\nSaruman and exiled him from the Shire, but before he could leave, Gríma\nWormtongue killed Saruman by slitting his throat with a dagger, on the\nvery doorstep of Bag End.\n\nLegacy\n\nAfter his departure from Orthanc, King Elessar entered the tower with\nthe intent of re-ordering that realm. Inside, Elessar's men found many\ntreasures that Saruman had conned off of King Théoden. There was a\nsecret closet that could only be found with the aid of Gimli; it\ncontained the original Elendilmir, which had presumed to be lost forever\nwhen Isildur perished in the Gladden Fields, as well as a golden chain\nwhich was presumed to have once borne the One Ring.\n\nFate\n\nSaruman, being a Maia, did not truly die. His spirit separated from his\nbody much like Sauron's after the Downfall of Númenor. As an incorporeal\nspirit, he should have been called to the Halls of Mandos, but the tale\nimplies that he was barred from returning. Tolkien indicated that his\nspirit was left naked, powerless and wandering, never to return to\nMiddle-earth:\n\n\nNames\n\n-   CURUMO is the Quenya name for Saruman. Its Tengwar spelling is , and\n    its IPA pronunciation is .\n-   CURUNÍR is the Sindarin name for Saruman the White. It roughly\n    translates to mean “man of skill”. Curunir was the original name\n    given to Saruman as the leader of the Wizards, or Istari, who first\n    came to Middle-earth to combat the evils of Sauron. Late in the\n    Third Age around the time of the War of the Ring, this name was less\n    known and rarely used save among the Elves and even rarely used by\n    them except for their leaders, such as Elrond in Rivendell, Celeborn\n    and Galadriel in Lothlórien, and Círdan at the Grey Havens.\n-   '''Saruman '''as called by Gandalf, Men in Rohan, and Men in most\n    other places.\n-   SHARKU is the name given to him by his Uruk-Hai meaning in Black\n    Speech “Old Man”.\n-   SHARKEY, a form of the word is later used by the Ruffians at the\n    Shire, from “Sharku”.\n\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nSaruman's status as chief of the Wizards and head of the White Council\n(before Gandalf) gave him arsenal to a variety of powers. Though he\nwould eventually be defeated by Gandalf in the end, Saruman's powers and\nabilities were very mighty indeed at the peak of his power.\n\nBy far Saruman's greatest power (and the only one he was able to retain\nafter the downfall of Isengard) is speech. He seems to have the ability\nto bend any but the absolute strongest minds to his will, simply by\nspeaking to them. Even with Isengard broken and Saruman's treachery\nrevealed, Gandalf had to be very careful, Saruman could ensnare almost\nanyone with the power of his voice, few can contend with his will.\nGandalf was not drawn into this power when he confronted Saruman; in\ntrying to enchant some in the company, he left others out of his\ndesigns, and thus could not ensnare everyone at once. However, even in\nthis situation, it is said that only Gandalf himself remained totally\nunmoved. Aragorn stated during this time that few other than Gandalf,\nElrond and Galadriel could resist his voice, even at this point. Saruman\nlater used his persuasive power to escape Orthanc, convincing Treebeard\nto let him go.\n\nSaruman was extremely learned in Ringlore and mechanics, and his\nknowledge enabled him to create great forges. Unfortunately, it was\nSaruman's extensive knowledge of the Rings of Power that led to his\ndownfall, as he became enamored of the power of the rings, and\nparticularly the One Ring.",

    "text": "GALADRIEL was the co-ruler and Lady of Lothlórien alongside her husband,\nLord Celeborn - however, neither of them took royal titles, as they only\nsaw themselves as the Guardians of The Golden Wood.\n\nShe was the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the\nÑoldor and of Eärwen, whose cousin was Lúthien. Her elder brothers were\nFinrod Felagund,  Orodreth, Angrod, and Aegnor. Galadriel was a niece\nof Fëanor, one of the most important elves of the First Age.\n\nShe was one of the greatest of the Eldar in Middle-earth, and surpassed\nnearly all others in beauty, knowledge, and power. She was also the\nbearer of Nenya, one of the three Elven rings of power. Tolkien thought\nof her, along with Gil-galad the Elven-king, as one of the mightiest and\nfairest of all the Elves left in Middle-earth.\n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n\n\nGaladriel was born in Valinor during the Years of the Trees, before the\nFirst Age had even begun. Much of Galadriel's story is confusing, and\nthere are several distinct tales told about her collected in the\nUnfinished Tales. According to the older account, used in the published\n_Silmarillion_, Galadriel was an eager participant and leader in the\nrebellion of the Ñoldor and their flight from Valinor due to her desire\nto one day rule over a patch of Middle-earth herself.\n\nShe was eager to see Middle-earth, having heard of it from Fëanor, and\nwanted to rule a realm of her own. She swore no oaths and was like\nminded with her cousin Fingon, son of Fingolfin.\n\nHowever, separated from Fëanor and his kin, she and her people did not\ntake part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. They followed Fingolfin\ninstead and crossed the Helcaraxë in the far north.\n\nFirst Age\n\nOnce in Beleriand, she lived nominally with one of her brothers, most\nlikely Finrod, but spent much time at the court of Thingol and Melian in\nMenegroth, where she arrived in FA 52 and was welcomed because of her\nfamily relationship to Thingol's brother Olwë, Galadriel's maternal\ngrandfather. She met Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, in Doriath. She\nalso traveled to visit her brother, Finrod, in his realm of Nargothrond\nmultiple times. Her three other brothers were killed during various\nbattles in the First Age.\n\nGaladriel became friends with Melian the Maia, who wanted to know the\ncause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only briefly narrated the\nstory to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the Kinslaying at\nAlqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. She dwelt in\nNargothrond with her brother Finrod, and asked him if he would take no\nwife. But Finrod had taken an oath only for himself, and his beloved had\nbeen left in Valinor.\n\nShe played a relatively insignificant part in the wars of the First Age,\nas she thought that defeating Morgoth was beyond the power of the Eldar,\nand when Morgoth was defeated by the coming of the Valar out of the West\nshe, having played no part in the Kinslaying, was offered safe return to\nValinor. But being prideful, she chose to remain in Middle-earth.\n\nSecond Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel traveled first to Lindon, where they ruled over a\ngroup of Elves as a fiefdom under Gil-galad. Sometime later, they had a\ndaughter, Celebrían. They moved eastward and established the realm of\nEregion, or Hollin, which they ruled under Gil-galad, the High King of\nthe Ñoldor. Eregion, to the west of the Misty Mountains near Moria, was\na prosperous kingdom during this time, and had open trade with the\nDwarves. Also, during this time, they made contact with a Nandorin\nsettlement in the valley of the Anduin, later to be known as Lothlórien.\nSubsequently, while Celebrimbor now ruled over Eregion, they left\nEregion by way of the mines of Khazad-dûm and became the Lord and Lady\nof Lothlórien.\n\n\n\nDuring the Second Age, the Maia Annatar, the “Lord of Gifts”, guided\nCelebrimbor and the other Ñoldor of Eregion in the creation of the Rings\nof Power. Galadriel took an immediate distrust to Annatar, and it later\nturned out that this mistrust was justified, as he was finally revealed\nto be Sauron. It was she who counseled Celebrimbor in the hiding of the\nrings, and when Eregion was attacked, Galadriel was entrusted with one\nof the Three Rings of the Elves. Her ring was Nenya, the Ring of Water.\n\nConscious of Sauron's power, and wishing to thwart it, she did not\nopenly use the powers of her ring as long as the One Ring was in\nSauron's hands. However, during the Third Age, when the One Ring was\nlost, she put it to good use protecting the borders of her realm, for\nthe powers of her ring were protection, preservation, and concealment\nfrom evil.\n\nThird Age\n\nThrough Celebrían's wedding to Elrond, Galadriel was the grandmother of\nElladan, Elrohir, and Arwen.\n\nThe tales tell little of Galadriel or of Celeborn during many centuries\nin the Third Age, but after the formation of the White Council in TA\n2463 she put forth her might in opposition of Sauron. She played a\npivotal role in the formation of the Council, though her counsel to put\nGandalf at its head was not followed. After Sauron was ousted from\nhis fortress of Dol Guldur, Lórien kept vigilance over the region until\nthe time of the War of the Ring.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Galadriel hosted the Fellowship of the Ring\nafter their escape from the mines of Moria.\n\nOnce in Caras Galadhon, Galadriel allowed Frodo and Sam to peer into the\nMirror of Galadriel, enabling them to glimpse possible events of the\nfuture. She, in turn, was tested when Frodo Baggins later offered to\nplace the One Ring in her keeping. To illustrate what would happen if\nshe accepted, she presented an image of herself corrupted by the ring,\ndeclaring, “_In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I\nshall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the\nNight! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain!\nDreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations\nof the earth. All shall love me and despair!_” In the movie, what she\nsays is different, which is: \"_In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a\nqueen! Not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as\nthe sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me,\nand despair!\"_\n\nThen swiftly she returned to her original form, seemingly smaller and\nfrailer than before, declaring, “_I pass the test,_” refusing the Ring\nand accepting the fate of diminishing (as the time of the Dominion of\nMen had come), and returning at last to Valinor. As the Fellowship\ndeparted, she gave each member a gift and an Elven cloak, and outfitted\nthe party with boats and supplies. Gimli, in particular, was touched by\nGaladriel's lordliness and beauty, and asks for one strand of her golden\nhair as an heirloom of his house; she generously gave him three, which\nhe later set in an impregnable crystal.\n\nApart from the strands of hair given to Gimli, she gave a Mallorn seed\nand a small box of earth from her garden to Samwise Gamgee; a green\nstone set in silver to Aragorn, along with a scabbard for his sword; and\na belt each to Boromir, Merry, and Pippin. To Legolas she gave a long,\nstout bow of the Galadhrim. To Frodo she gave a magical phial, which\ncaptured the light of Eärendil's star, without which Frodo and Sam would\nhave been unable to pass through Shelob's lair to complete their quest.\nAfter the departure of the Fellowship, Galadriel acted to ensure the\nsuccess of the quest. It was she who summoned Gwaihir to rescue Gandalf\noff the peak of Celebdil, and it was she who nursed him back to health,\ndressing him in white, symbolizing his status as the new leader of the\norder. \n\nLater, she sent word to Aragorn about the Paths of the Dead, and\nmessages to the Rangers of the North asking for their aid in the War. As\nSauron put forth all his power during the end of the War of the Ring, he\nwas aware of the threat of the Elves and their ancient potency, so he\nsent armies to besiege many of their settlements in the North while\nsimultaneously assailing the major cities of Men and Dwarves. Lórien\nitself was assaulted three times, but the armies of Dol Guldur were\ndriven back due to the courage of the Elves and the power of Galadriel's\nRing.\n\n\n\nIt is said that the power of her Ring could not be overcome unless\nSauron himself would come to do battle. After the fall of Sauron she,\nwith Thranduil of Mirkwood and their elven allies, crossed the Anduin\ninto Dol Guldur, where they tore down its walls and laid bare its pits.\nShe then traveled to Minas Tirith for the wedding of King Aragorn and\nLady Arwen, and continued living in Lórien until TA 3021 when she\ntraveled to the Grey Havens and, with the remaining Ring-bearers, took a\nship and returned at last to the Undying Lands whence she had come so\nlong ago.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\n_The Lady Galadriel - “Lady of Light” - grandmother of Lady Arwen, is an\nElven Queen of extraordinary beauty, with her timeless features and\ngolden river of hair._\n\nGaladriel was highly praised for her beauty, particularly that of her\nhair, which was a deep and radiant gold, shot with silver. It was said\nby the elves of Tirion to have ensnared the light of the two trees,\nTelperion and Laurelin, and possibly to have inspired the creation of\nthe Silmarils by Fëanor. She was also the tallest of elf-women, standing\nat around 6 feet 4 inches, or 193 centimeters. Because of her wisdom and\npower, she had very important roles throughout the history of\nMiddle-earth, especially during her time in Eregion and during the War\nof the Ring. She had a penchant for dressing in the purest white.\nShe was known, especially in her younger days, as being quite prideful.\nHowever, by the end of the Third Age, that pride had been tempered a\ngreat deal by age.\n\nRegarding her decision to remain in Middle-earth, a passage says:\n\n\nPowers\n\n_She is, however, no mere fey being, but a lady of great power. She\nbears one of the Great Rings - Nenya - the Ring of Adamant, and with the\nOne Ring in her grasp as well, she would be a mighty match for the Dark\nLord Sauron._\n\nGaladriel possessed a tremendous amount of magical powers, and was said\nto be the greatest of the Ñoldor after Fëanor.\n\nWhen she still lived in the Undying Lands, she had been a pupil of\nYavanna and Aulë, and she later became a friend of Melian the Maia.\nHence, it can be deduced that she had learned her powers from these\nthree illustrious personages, though the nature of her magic is still\nnot well-understood.\n\nThe vast majority of Galadriel's powers stemmed from the legendary\nartifact she controlled: Nenya, the Ring of Water. In some tales, she\nwas also depicted with the powers of communicating over vast distances,\npredicting the future, and even cloaking her mind from other\ntremendously powerful beings (she once stated that Sauron could not\nperceive her mind, though she could perceive his). It is also possible\nthat her powers of divination were either derived from or accentuated by\nher mirror, which could reveal events of the past, present, and future.\n\nHowever, due to her incredibly enigmatic nature, even the immensely\nskillful Saruman and an Elf as perceptive as Elrond found it difficult\nto understand her powers, and they were such to bring doubt to the minds\nof the non-Elven inhabitants of Middle-earth. Whatever they might have\nbeen, it must still be noted that Galadriel had used them for good:\nprotecting Lórien from any attack (it was said that only Sauron himself\ncould have overcome this protection), and destroying Dol Guldur (a\nfortress whose power was multiplied by Sauron's magic). Last but not\nleast, Galadriel was also skilled in ósanwe (the ability to communicate\nwith others through thoughts): after the destruction of the One Ring,\nGaladriel communicated mentally with Elrond and Gandalf on their return\njourney from Minas Tirith.\n\nBesides her magical powers, Galadriel was also extremely wise and\nintelligent: she was one of the very few who were not fooled by Sauron\nin the Second Age, and therefore suggested to Celebrimbor to hide the\nThree Rings. She also refrained from openly using the powers of Nenya\nwhile the One Ring was in Sauron's possession, and only did so after the\nOne Ring was lost (for it was only then that it was safe enough for her\nto do so). When Frodo offered her the One Ring, Galadriel managed to\nreject the undeniable temptation, for she was wise enough to know that,\nthough she might start off with good intentions with the One Ring in her\npossession, she would only become a tyrant as terrible as Sauron in the\nend. This could be viewed as a testament to her excellent understanding\nof the seductive nature of power, as well as her awareness of her own\npersonal limitations.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   Galadriel is the last child of Finarfin, and additionally, the last\n    remaining grandchild of Finwë (with the possible exception of\n    Maglor).\n\n\nEtymology\n\n''Galadriel ''was originally named ARTANIS (“noble woman”) which was her\nFather-name and NERWEN (“man-maiden”), which was her Mother-name\n(referring to her height and strength). _Galadriel_ is the Sindarinized\nversion of Telerin Quenya ALATÁRIEL, the name given to her by her lover\nCeleborn, meaning “maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance”,\nwhich referred to her hair.\n\nThe name GALADHRIEL was used outside Lórien by the people who did not\nknow the ancient days and Galadriel's history, confusing her name with\nthe Elvish word _galadh_ (“tree”) and the name of the Galadhrim, the\npeople of Lórien.\n\nNames and Titles\n\nShe is referred to as THE LADY OF LÓRIEN, LADY OF LIGHT, THE LADY OF THE\nGALADHRIM, or THE LADY OF THE WOOD interchangeably. Within the realm of\nLothlórien, she was referred to as simply LADY GALADRIEL or THE LADY.\n\nWhen she and Celeborn were being referred to collectively, they were\nknown as THE LORD AND LADY.",

    "text": "The WITCH-KING OF ANGMAR was the leader of the Nazgûl or Ringwraiths,\nand Sauron's second-in-command during the Second and Third Ages. Once a\nNúmenórean king of men, he was corrupted by one of the nine Rings of\nPower that had been given to the lords of men, and became an undead\nwraith in the service of Sauron.  \n\nAfter the first defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance, the\nWitch-king fled to Angmar, a kingdom he ruled for over thousands of\nyears until he returned to Mordor to lead Sauron's armies in the War of\nthe Ring. He stabbed Frodo Baggins on Weathertop during the first months\nof Frodo's venture out of the Shire to Rivendell. \n\nHe was killed in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields by Meriadoc\nBrandybuck and Éowyn, niece of King Théoden, at the end of the War. \n\n\nBiography\n\nThe Second and Third Ages\n\n\n\nThe first sighting of the Nazgûl in Middle-earth was reported in SA\n2251. For the next 1200 years, the LORD OF THE NAZGÛL would serve Sauron\nas his second in command. He fought in the war against the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men between SA 3434 and SA 3441. It was in SA 3441 when\nSauron was finally defeated and the nine Nazgûl disappeared from\nMiddle-earth.\n\nOne thousand years into the Third Age, Sauron took a new form as the\nNecromancer, and founded the fortress of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood\nin TA 1050. This signaled the return of the Nine Nazgûl to Middle-earth.\n\n\n\nThe Lord of the Nazgûl reappeared in TA 1300 in the north near the lost\nrealm of Arnor. There he founded the kingdom of Angmar. It was after the\nformation of Angmar and several conflicts with the Dúnedain of the North\nthat the Lord of the Nazgûl received the title of “Witch-king, Lord of\nAngmar”.\n\nHe then began his open war campaign with the three divided kingdoms of\nArnor (Arthedain, Rhudaur, and Cardolan). In TA 1356, the Witch-king\ninvaded the kingdom of Rhudaur and replaced the Dúnedain king of the\nland with a hill-chief allied to Angmar. King Argeleb of Arthedain was\nkilled trying to defend Rhudaur against Angmar. In TA 1409 the troops of\nthe Witch-king assaulted the fortress of Amon Sûl and burned the tower,\nduring which conflict king Arveleg of Arthedain was killed. The\nWitch-king then invaded and destroyed the kingdom of Cardolan. Then the\nWitch-king invaded Arthedain and came close to destroying it but King\nAraphor with the help of the elves of Lindon and Rivendell managed to\ndefeat the invading forces.\n\nSoon, the only resistance against the Witch-king's forces was the\nwestern kingdom of Arthedain. The Witch-king continued his war for\nhundreds of years. In TA 1636, the Witch-king sent wights to the\nBarrow-downs in Cardolan in order to prevent the rebirth of the kingdom.\nThe Witch-king claimed ultimate victory in the north in TA 1974, when\nhis forces captured Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain. With its\ncapture, the final kingdom collapsed, and with it, the last remnants of\nthe lost realm of Arnor were destroyed.\n\nThe Witch-king gladly took his seat of power in the newly captured\nFornost. But his glory did not last long, for in TA 1975, general Eärnur\nof Gondor landed at the harbours of the Grey Havens, leading an army of\nGondor. His army was joined by the Elves of Lindon and the remnant of\nthe northern Dúnedain, and they marched on the Witch-king.\n\nAt Fornost\n\n\n\nEärnur's host did not meet the Witch-king at Fornost, but on the plains\nwest of it toward Lake Evendim, home of the ancient kings of Arnor,\nAnnúminas. The battle would forever be known as the Battle of Fornost.\nEärnur's Dúnedain army was later joined in the mists of battle by\nGlorfindel and his Elven army from Rivendell. The Witch-king revealed\nhimself and challenged Eärnur. As Eärnur attempted to attack, his horse\nwas overwhelmed with fear of the Nazgûl lord and bucked. The Witch-king,\ntaunting Eärnur, fled the battlefield. When Eärnur attempted to follow,\nGlorfindel stopped him with a warning that would become prophetic in the\nfuture:\n\n    _“Do not pursue him! He will not return to these lands. Far off yet\n    is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall.”_\n\nThe Witch-king, having destroyed the North-kingdom, fled to the North.\nAngmar was left leaderless and soon collapsed.\n\nReturn to Mordor\n\n Having ruined the\nDunedain kingdoms in Eriador, the Witch-king returned to Mordor.\nAlthough Sauron was still hiding in Dol Guldur (disguised as the\nNecromancer), the other eight Nazgûl rallied around the Witch-king.\nTogether, the nine of them laboured to rebuild their master's power in\nMordor, gathering huge Orcish hordes about themselves. In the year TA\n2000 they came out of Mordor and began attacking Gondor, which was\nrecovered from the Great Plague but devastated by the Wainriders. In TA\n2002 they captured Minas Ithil, and took the place for their own. It\nbecame known as Minas Morgul and its citadel “the Tower of Witchcraft”,\nand remained a place of great evil for centuries thereafter.\n\nIn TA 2043, King Eärnil II of Gondor passed away and his son Eärnur, the\nWitch-king's old enemy, inherited the throne. Upon his coronation, the\nWitch-king challenged him to single combat, but Eärnur refused. However,\nseven years later in TA 2050 the Witch-king again challenged him—and\nEärnur accepted. The Gondorian King rode out of Minas Tirith to fight\nthe Witch-king at Minas Morgul. He entered the city's gates and was\nnever seen again, thus ending the reign of the Gondorian Kings and\nbeginning the rule of the Stewards of Gondor. In TA 2063 the Watchful\nPeace began when Sauron fled Dol Guldur and hid in the East, and the\nNazgûl remained quiet in Minas Morgul for the next 400 years.\n\nIn TA 2460, the Watchful Peace ended when\nSauron, disguised as the Necromancer, returned with increased strength\nto Dol Guldur, and in TA 2475 the Witch-king led hordes of Orcs and\nHaradrim against Osgiliath and seized its eastern half. The city was\nruined, and the great stone bridge linking the east and west banks of\nthe Anduin river was destroyed, dealing a devastating blow to the morale\nof Gondor.\n\nIn TA 2941 the Necromancer was finally expelled from Dol Guldur when\nGandalf confirmed that he truly was Sauron in disguise. Sauron returned\nto Mordor and began preparations to find his One Ring. He began the\nreconstruction of Barad-dûr in TA 2951 and sent three Ringwraiths to\nre-capture Dol Guldur. And in TA 3018, with the capture of Gollum,\nSauron learned, through torture, where the land of the Hobbits lay.\nUnfortunately, Gollum had lied, and the Ringwraiths went to Saruman, who\nrefused to tell them the location of the land of the Halflings. The\nWitch King chanced upon Grima Wormtongue in Rohan, who, for fear of his\nlife, told the Nazgûl where the Shire was. Sauron opened the gates of\nMinas Morgul and sent forth the Witch-king and the other Nazgûl\ndisguised as Black Riders to fetch his Ring.\n\nWith an attack on Osgiliath that was in fact a ruse, the Nazgûl and army\nof Orcs were able to cross the river and ride west.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n The Witch-king and the other\neight Nazgûl rode swiftly from Mordor to the lands of the Shire. They\ncontinued to search for “Baggins” until they tracked him to Buckland.\nThe Nine Riders raided Buckland but could not find the Ring.\n\nThe Witch-king led four other Nazgûl to Weathertop where they discovered\nFrodo, Aragorn, and the other hobbits. The Ringwraiths attacked the\nparty and the Witch-king wounded Frodo with a Morgul blade. Though\nsuccessfully driven off by Aragorn, Frodo's wound threatened to turn him\ninto a wraith like the Nazgûl. Elrond of Rivendell sent Glorfindel to\nguide Frodo to Rivendell where Elrond could heal his wound. Glorfindel's\nrace to Rivendell lured the Ringwraiths into the Bruinen. Here, Elrond\nreleased a Great Flood, with Gandalf giving the waves of the torrent the\nform of horses. This flood destroyed the physical forms of the\nRingwraiths, killed their horses, and sent the Wraiths back to their\nmaster in Mordor, buying the Fellowship time to plan an attack.\n\nWith their return to Mordor, Sauron bestowed upon the Nazgûl great\nwinged creatures as their new mounts. Sauron used the lesser eight\nNazgûl for reconnaissance work and the occasional shock troop. The\nWitch-king, however, returned to Minas Morgul and resumed the role of\ncommander of Sauron's forces. He then began battles to capture\nOsgiliath, finally issuing from Morgul with a great host. However, at\nthe bridge over Morgulduin he pauses, feeling the Ring nearby; until\nFrodo touches the Phial and turns aside his enemy's thought.\n\nSiege of Gondor\n\n The final Battle of Osgiliath was\nfought on March 13, 3019 of the Third Age against Faramir's rangers.\nFaramir's forces could not hold the Orc hordes under the control of\nGothmog. Faramir pulled his forces back to Minas Tirith assailed by\nflying Nazgûl, losing much of his force in the retreat. A second time he\nwent forth, and from that assault only Faramir returned to Minas Tirith,\ngravely wounded, in Gandalf's arms. With Gondor's defeat at Osgiliath,\nnothing stood in the way of Sauron's ambitions of destroying Minas\nTirith and the Free People's hopes.\n\nOn March 14, Orcs, Haradrim, and Easterling forces numbering over\n200,000 marched on the gates of Minas Tirith. Sauron had bestowed the\nWitch-king with newfound strength, making his appears on a black horse, his\npresence casting a shadow of utter paralysis and fear upon defender and\nfoe. Crying incantations in “some forgotten tongue,” he enhances the\npower of Grond, and weakens the already damaged gate of Minas Tirith.\nThe ram breaks open the gate, and the defenders inside flee, terror\nstricken by his dark presence. However, his march in is hindered by\nGandalf the White, the only one able to withstand his power. There is a\nduel of words between them, and the Witch-king doffs his hood revealing\na crown on empty air, mocking Gandalf as “old fool” and bidding him die,\nthreateningly draws his blade, which blazes on its own accord. Gandalf\nholds firm, ready to do battle, but before they can clash the horns of\nRohan sound, signaling the arrival of aid to Minas Tirith. The\nWitch-king then withdraws to order the defence against this new threat.\n\nDeath\n\n The Witch-king mounted his Fell beast\nand rallied his troops against the furious charge of the Rohirrim. The\narmy of Rohan was slowed the initial charge blunted by their encounter\nwith the Mumakil, allowing the hosts of Mordor to re-organize. The\nWitch-king took this opportunity to strike down King Théoden while his\ntroops were in confusion. Flying on the back of his fell beast, he drove\nupon Théoden. The advancing Rohirrim horses panicked as his beast\nattacked. Théoden's horse, Snowmane, became frightened, was struck by a\nblack dart and fell upon its master.\n\nAs the Witch-king hovered over Théoden on his fell beast, Éowyn and the\nhobbit Merry stood in his way.\n\n  ÉOWYN: _Be gone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in\n  peace!_\n\n  NAZGÛL: _Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay\n  thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation,\n  beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy\n  shriveled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye._\n    ÉOWYN: _Do what you will, but I will hinder it, if I may._\n    NAZGÛL: _Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!_\n  ÉOWYN: _But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am,\n  Eomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Be gone,\n  if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you,\n  if you touch him._\n\nÉowyn slew his fell beast with a single stroke of her sword, severing\nits neck. The Witch-king arose, and with a cry of hatred he shattered\nher shield and broke her left arm with a single blow of his mace. But as\nhe towered over her, preparing to deliver the final blow, Merry stabbed\nhis sword from behind into the sinew of the Witch-king's knee. While the\nWitch-king was distracted, Éowyn drove her sword where the head of the\nwraith would have been, slaying him.\n\nThe prophesy of Glorfindel so many centuries before had thus come to\npass. For not by the hand of  man had he failed, but by those of a\nhobbit and a woman. Now, with his death, the tide of the battle had\nchanged, and ultimately the outcome of the War.\n\n  GANDALF: _He studies the signs: the Sword that robbed him of his\n  treasure remade; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and the\n  defeat unlooked-for of his first assault; the fall of his great\n  Captain. His doubt will be growing, even as we speak here. His Eye is\n  now straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So\n  we must keep it._\n\nOnly a few days later, during the final council of war before the\nassault on the Black Gate, Gandalf predicted that the defeat of the\nWitch-King, Sauron's single most powerful servant, not to mention the\nloss of the battle itself, was one of several factors that would\nundermine Sauron's confidence in the superiority of his forces and make\nhim more likely to throw his entire remaining strength at whatever force\nof Gondorians and Rohirrim challenged him - thus giving Frodo and Sam\ntheir one slender chance to pass unhindered through Mordor and convey\nthe One Ring to Mount Doom.\n\nThis counsel proved correct, and no more than ten days later, Sauron\nhimself was finally defeated when the Ring was unmade.\n\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nAs a Nazgûl, the Witch-king had a wide arsenal of powers. He was\nsurrounded by an aura of fear, enough to make trained soldiers run in\nterror. Besides the common Black Breath, any weapon that struck the\nWitch-king would be destroyed (a fate shared by Meriadoc Brandybuck's\nand Éowyn's swords), and its bearer would be poisoned. This was so\nsevere that it was worse than a blow from his mace.\n\nThe Witch-king was also a feared sorcerer, having powers over the\nphysical world, breaking Frodo's sword with just a move of his hand, or\nweakening the Gates of Minas Tirith allowing the Grond to break them.\nThe spell he used to weaken it also caused it to explode in a flash of\nlightening. He could also light objects on fire. He was stronger at\nnight time. His power fluctuated greatly over his existence, as his\npowers were bound up with Sauron's own; the more powerful Sauron became,\nthe more powerful the Nazgûl became.\n\n\nRoots in Norse mythology\n\nAn undead “witch-king” named Þráinn appears in _Hrómundar saga\nGripssonar_. It is probable that this was Tolkien's source of\ninspiration. Although, another witch-king appears in Greek mythology,\nand is named Aeetes. What should be noted is that Aeetes' appearance\nbears more resemblance to the one of Angmar.",

The name _Gollum_ was\nderived from the sound of his disgusting gurgling, choking cough. His\nbirth can be estimated to have happened in the year TA 2430. His death\ndate is given as March 25, 3019.

His chief desire was\nto possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many\nyears after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains\nin the book _The Hobbit_. In the movies, he was a\ndeuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\n\n Once a predecessor of the Stoorish Hobbits, Sméagol\nspent the early years of his life living with his extended family under\na Matriarch, his grandmother. Around the year TA 2463, Sméagol became\nthe fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron, Isildur, and Déagol.\nDéagol was his cousin, and on Sméagol's birthday, they went fishing in\nthe Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that Déagol\nfound a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish.\nAlmost immediately, Sméagol fell to the power of the ring and demanded\nit as a birthday present. When Deágol refused, Sméagol promptly flew\ninto a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him\nto death and taking the ring as his own. Sméagol was quickly corrupted\nfurther by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his\ngrandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in\nthe Misty Mountains in around TA 2470. The Ring's malignant influence\ntwisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far\nbeyond its natural limits. He called it his “Precious” or his “Birthday\nPresent,” the latter as a justification for killing Déagol.\n\nLife under the Misty Mountains\n\n He lived in the Misty Mountains for over four\nhundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small\nrow boat), bats and Goblins when he could get them. Indeed, he made a\nsong about raw fish, that he uses as a riddle to Bilbo and much later\nsings to Frodo in a longer version. In later years, he found Hobbit and\nElven food repulsive.\n\nDuring his centuries under the Ring's influence, he developed a sort of\ndissociative identity disorder: Sméagol, his “good” personality, still\nvaguely remembered things like friendship and love, while Gollum, his\n“bad” personality, was a slave to the Ring and would kill anyone who\ntried to take it. Years later, Samwise Gamgee would name the good\npersonality “Slinker” (for his fawning, eager-to-please demeanor), and\nthe bad personality “Stinker”. The two personalities often quarreled\nwhen he talked to himself (as Tolkien put it, “through not having anyone\nelse to speak to”) and had a love/hate relationship, mirroring Gollum's\nlove and hatred for the Ring and for himself.\n\n\n\nIn July, TA 2941, during the Quest of Erebor, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins\nstumbled upon the subterranean lake on which he lived and found Gollum's\nRing. Gollum had lost the Ring while squabbling with an imp goblin in\nthe network of caves leading to the lake, though in fact it is more\nproper to say that the Ring abandoned Gollum, for it was known to have a\nwill of its own. As Gandalf says later, it looks after itself, trying to\nget back to Sauron. After the infamous Riddle Game, during which Gollum\nwas unaware of his loss, Gollum refused to show Bilbo the promised way\nout and plotted to murder him. When he went to get his “birthday\npresent,” however, he found that it was gone. He suddenly realized the\ntrue answer to Bilbo's last riddle—_“What have I got in my pocket?”_ -,\nbreaking into a rage and then begun to chase him in the tunnels. Bilbo\ninadvertently stumbled across the Ring's power of invisibility as he\nran, allowing him to follow Gollum to the back entrance of the\ncave. There, Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but was overcome\nwith pity, so he jumped over him to escape. As Bilbo ran, Gollum cried\nout, “Thief! Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!”; he did not\nimmediately follow Bilbo out of fear of being caught by the goblins, and\nso lingered in his cave.\n\nSearch for the Ring\n\nGollum eventually left the Mountains and pursued Bilbo a few years\nlater, but the trail was cold. He made his way south into Mordor where\nall evil was being drawn at the time, discovering the secret stair\nlocated near Minas Morgul and surviving an encounter with Shelob. He was\ncaptured on his return, taken to the dungeons of Barad-dur and forced to\nreveal to Sauron under intense torture what he knew about the Ring.\nGollum was then strangely freed, as he shows no particular loyalty\ntowards Sauron, but caught by Aragorn, then interrogated by Gandalf, who\nplaced him in the care of the Silvan Elves living in Thranduil's kingdom\nin Mirkwood. Assisted by Orcs he escaped them, and set off looking for\nthe Shire. He passed through Moria, but could not make it out of the\nEast gate. Seemingly he then just waited there until he got lucky when\nthe Fellowship passed through. However, as Frodo was a ring-bearer he\nmight have foreseen the passing of the ring. Alternatively, some of\nSaruman's or Sauron's spies may have revealed to him the Fellowship was\nheading towards Moria.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n\n\nGollum met and started following the Fellowship of the Ring in Moria,\nand was spotted and heard by Frodo on several occasions. On January 15,\n3019, the Fellowship was divided when Gandalf disappeared while fighting\na Balrog (though he later returned). Gollum continued trailing the\nremaining members. It is unknown how he crossed the Bridge of\nKhazad-dûm, but he came with them to Lórien without their knowing.\nGollum followed their boats down Anduin (floating on a log) to Rauros\nand pursued Frodo and Sam across the Emyn Muil when they struck out on\ntheir own towards Mordor. Gollum followed them, but after a\nconfrontation (in which he bit and nearly strangled Sam for the Ring)\nFrodo subdued him and threatened to kill him with Sting, the Elvish\nblade that Gollum had apparently recognized by its former owner - Bilbo.\nFrodo tied an Elven Rope around Gollum's neck for a leash, but the mere\ntouch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature,\nFrodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore\nby the “Precious” itself and Frodo released him. The unlikely company,\nguided by Gollum, made its way to the Black Gate, the entrance to\nMordor.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, it was revealed that Gollum, having lived in a cave for\nhundreds of years, feared both the sun and the moon, calling them the\n'Yellow Face' and the 'White Face' respectively.\n\nFrodo's kindness brought out the “Sméagol” personality, and he made at\nleast some effort to keep his promise. The two had a strange sort of\nbond from both having been Ring-bearers; in Gollum, Frodo saw his\npossible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself.\nApart from Gandalf and Bilbo, Frodo is the only person known to have\nshown kindness towards Gollum, who is hated instantly by everyone he\nmeets, being perceived as filthy, slimy, sneaky and suspect by groups as\ndifferent as the Orcs of Cirith Ungol and the Rangers of Ithilien.\n\nWhen the Black Gate was reached and found to be well guarded, Gollum\nconvinced them not to go that way, saying that they would be caught and\nSauron would regain the Ring. Gollum said he would lead them south,\nwhere he knew of another entrance into Mordor, in which Frodo complied,\ndespite Sam's suspicions.\n\nFrodo and Sam were caught by Faramir, and Gollum followed them. When\nFrodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner, however, he felt\nbetrayed, allowing the “Gollum” personality to take total\ncontrol. Faramir found out that the place Gollum was taking them was\ncalled Cirith Ungol. He then warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that\nplace.\n\nFrodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and began crossing the Morgul Vale\nand proceeded to climb the stairs of Cirith Ungol, in the\nborder-mountains of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Gollum\nvisited the great spider Shelob, child of Ungoliant, because he was\nplanning to betray the Hobbits by turning them to Shelob for food and\nthen take the Ring for himself. The fact that Gollum managed to forge an\nalliance with Shelob is also remarkable, as she was otherwise known for\ndevouring and killing everything on sight. When he returned the Hobbits\nwere asleep. The sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent,\nas he began to pet Frodo's hair. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly\nto Gollum and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through\nwith his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Torech Ungol.\n\nJust as Frodo warned him, Gollum's betrayal of his oath ultimately led\nto his undoing, for Frodo and Sam escaped from her lair and also Cirith\nUngol. They came against all odds to the fiery volcano Mount Doom.\nGollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and\ntake the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination,\nhe attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on\nsight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but he relented out of sheer\npity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten (but still wily)\ncreature.\n\nDeath\n\nMoments later, Frodo was standing on the edge of the Crack of Doom, but,\nunwilling to destroy the Ring, claimed it for himself and put it on.\nThen Gollum attacked the hobbits again. Gollum knocked out Sam with a\nrock whilst Frodo was invisible. But Gollum was able to track his\nfootprints and jumped on Frodo. The two fought and finally Gollum bit\noff Frodo's finger with the ring on it.\n\n\n\nHere Bilbo's long-ago kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded,\nfor Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance\nand fell in, (In the movie Frodo assaults Gollum, and he trips) taking\nthe Ring and finger with him along with a final cry of “_Precious_!”.\nThe ring was burned in the molten lava with Gollum consumed with it as\nwell. Had Gollum not lived to play this final part, there was a good\nchance that Sauron would have regained his Ring, as he knew where Frodo\nwas as soon as he put it on.\n\nLegacy\n\nYears after Gollum's death, Frodo would forgive him, as Gandalf had told\nFrodo that Gollum wasn't actually an evil being that deserved his death,\nbut was only a poor being, bound to the Ring's will, and that Frodo's\nfate would be like Gollum's if he kept the Ring. For if Gollum did not\nstay with Sam and Frodo to the end of Mordor, Frodo's inability to\ndestroy the Ring would have alerted Sauron to it, and all good in the\nworld of Middle-earth would disappear.\n\nGollum was also remembered for being the Ring-bearer that kept the Ring\nfor about five hundred years, the second longest bearer besides Sauron\nhimself, who bore it from SA 1600 to his defeat in SA 3441. He is also\nremarkable for having seen Sauron in person (when being tortured by him)\nand for managing to form an alliance with Shelob. As a traveller,\nexplorer and Ranger he is perhaps the equal of Aragorn and Gandalf,\neasily travelling alone through extremely hostile terrains, and\nseemingly having travelled very widely. For instance, he found his own\nway through the Dead Marshes as well as discovering for himself the\nsecret pass of Cirith Ungol. Also he manages to find his way through\nMoria from the East entrance to the West gate, something which even\nGandalf did only with some difficulty.\n\nIronically the one being who suffered the most from the One Ring was the\none who manages to destroy it in the end. Gollum or Sméagol undoubtedly\nsuffered the most from the One Ring as for almost all his unnaturally\nlong life he is tortured by the ring past insanity into total mental\ndestruction.\n\n\nBackground\n\nIn the first edition of _The Hobbit_, Gollum did not appear quite as\nwretched or as bound to the Ring. Tolkien revised this characterization\nto fit the concept of the Ruling Ring developed during the writing of\n_The Lord of the Rings_. Tolkien then explained the version given in the\nfirst edition as a lie that Bilbo made up to tell the Dwarves and\nGandalf.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nIn the first edition of The Hobbit, Tolkien made no reference to his\nsize, leading several illustrators to portray him as being very large.\nTolkien realized the omission, and clarified in later editions that he\nwas of average hobbit size and in “The Lord of the Rings”, there is a\nreference to Sam being “little less in height” than he is. Tolkien\ndescribes Gollum as either dark, bone-white or sallow (pale yellow): at\none point, the Men of Ithilien mistake his silhouette (seen from a\ndistance) for a tailless black squirrel. Gorbag and Shagrat describe him\nas a dark fellow. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the\nappearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that\nGollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor\nlight. The Hobbit states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth\nsharpening rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing.\nDespite these details, he is generally depicted wearing a loincloth or\nnaked in illustrations and adaptations.\n\n\n\nGollum was a good survivor and was very keen eyed and quick of hand this\nmade him an excellent fisherman. He could spot and catch fish in almost\nany level of light and waters. He fished the waters of the Misty\nMountain's underground lake for centuries in almost complete darkness\nand almost anywhere he had to after leaving his cave in search of the\nRing and the thief Baggins. He was known to eat almost anything that was\nliving or edible and could stomach anything raw and uncooked. He was\nalso very good at not being seen and was an excellent waterman making\nuse of anything that could float which made it possible for him to\nfollow the Fellowship for so long.\n\n\nPronunciation\n\nIn both the 1981 BBC radio adaptation and in the Peter Jackson\nmovies, _Sméagol_ is pronounced as “SMEE-gol”, although the placement of\nthe acute accent suggests that the correct pronunciation is\n“SMAY-uh-gol”, IPA . On the other hand, in Tolkien's recordings of _The\nLord of the Rings_ he also pronounced it “SMEE-gol” or “SMEE-AH-GOL” ,\nsuggesting that _éa_ should either be pronounced as a hard “e”-sound or\nas a diphthong _ea_, and not as two distinct vowels “e” and “a”. Tolkien\nhad a habit in his writing to put diacritics in varying places, as can\nalso be seen in the name _Eärendil_, which also occurs spelt _Ëarendil_.\nIt should also be noted that “Sméagol” bears strong resemblance to Old\nEnglish _smēaġan_, a verb meaning “to ponder”. If this was Tolkien's\nintention, then the acute may have been meant to substitute for the\nmacron. In any case, when trying to pronounce _Sméagol_, it should be\nkept in mind that the pronunciation rules given in the Appendices for\n_The Lord of the Rings_ are for the Elvish languages, and not for (old)\nEnglish representing Westron and related languages.\n\nSméagol's “real” Westron name was _Trahald_, of the meaning \"burrowing,\nworming in or “apt to creep into a hole”. In both Westron and Old\nEnglish, Sméagol's name is related to Smaug's: Smaug's name in “true\nDalish” was _Trâgu_, and the Trah- stem in Trahald and Trâgu is thus a\ncognate of the Germanic stem present in both Sméagol, and Smaug (with a\nmeaning of squeezing through a hole.)",

    "text": "CELEBRIMBOR was a Ñoldorin prince, and the last in the line of the House\nof Fëanor, who lived in Middle-earth. He was a ruler of Eregion in the\nSecond Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his\ncreation of the three greatest Elven Rings of Power: Vilya, Narya, and\nNenya.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son\nof Finwë and his first wife Miriel) and Nerdanel. During the First\nAge, he lived with his father in Nargothrond, but took no part in the\ndeeds of Curufin and Celegorm regarding Lúthien, Beren, and Finrod. He\nin fact repudiated his father's deeds, and did not follow his father and\nuncle when they were expelled from Nargothrond.\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing\nwith the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling\nhimself _Annatar_ (“Lord of Gifts”), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion.\nHe claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and\ninstructed them in the art of ring-making. Celebrimbor distrusted\nhim, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and\ninstruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft,\nbut unknown to them the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding\nmagic into the rings.\n\nIn secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all\nthe lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence\nover those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on\nhis finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their\nbearers, the elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor\nand the elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings\nfrom him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were\ncreated by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron\nand thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to\nthe One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of\nthe Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after\nthe principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water,\nrespectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and\nNarya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien.\n\n\n\nSauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm.\nCelebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to\ndisclose where the lesser rings were, but he would not reveal the\nwhereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for\nsafekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with\narrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner as Sauron\nattacked the elves. He was the last direct descendant of the line of\nFëanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate is\nunknown and is said by some legends to still wander the shores of the\nSea. It is unknown if he married or not or if he had children or not.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was TELPERINQUAR, which means “Silver-fist” or “Hand of\nsilver” in Quenya. It comes from the words _telpë_ (“silver”) and _quár_\n(“fist”). His mother-name remains unknown. The name CELEBRIMBOR is the\nSindarin translation of his father-name, which comes from _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _baur_ (“fist”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nUnlike both his father and his grandfather, Celebrimbor was portrayed as\nbeing both selfless and kind, and was neither prideful nor covetous of\nthat which he created. He was described to have an “almost Dwarvish\nobsession with crafts”; he became a famous artificer and smith in\nboth Gondolin and Eregion. His love for crafts took him to Eregion,\nwhere he was introduced to a precious metal and called it Mithril.\nMithril was mined by Dwarves in their nearby Mine Realm of Khazad-dum,\nalso named Moria. Great friendship with the Dwarves of Moria developed,\nskills and secrets were shared between the two peoples for many years\nvia The High Road which was built between the two realms. But a long\nperiod of peace would not last, for upon realizing the trap which Sauron\nhad devised for him, Celebrimbor was filled with anxiety and fear for\nhis people, and was later described as the heroic defender of\nEregion.\n\n\nImportant Works\n\n\n\n-   Rings of Power\n    -   The Nine Rings of Men (with Annatar)\n    -   The Seven Rings of the Dwarves (with Annatar)\n    -   The Three Rings of the Elves\n-   Doors of Durin (with Narvi) \n\n\nOther forms of the legendarium\n\nIn some accounts, Celebrimbor was a Sindar elf, an ancestor of Daeron,\nwho used Feanorian scripts.\n\nLater, Celebrimbor was changed and became of Ñoldorin origin, and a\nsurvivor of the Fall of Gondolin. In the _Unfinished Tales_, a\nstatement claims Celebrimbor to be one of the Teleri who accompanied\nCeleborn to exile.\n\nAnother version of the story has Celebrimbor revolt against Galadriel,\nafter Galadriel and Celeborn established Eregion . Celebrimbor and\nGaladriel were later reconciled once Sauron's trickery was revealed.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptions\n\nVideo games\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor appears in the video games _Middle-earth: Shadow of\nMordor_and _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_, as the wraith assisting the\nranger Talion in destroying the forces of Sauron. Developers have\nrevealed that he assists Talion due to the guilt he feels for creating\nthe Rings of Power, and thus he feels ultimately responsible for the\ntrouble Middle-earth is in. However, the Celebrimbor that appears in the\ngame differs from the Tolkien Celebrimbor in that he not only makes the\nthree Elf rings, but he crafts all of the Rings of Power, and when\ncaptured helps Sauron reforge the One Ring (via the inscription of the\nlettering of the Ring upon it) and assists him in creating the Nazgul by\naccompanying Sauron to the men who eventually would become the Nine; he\nalso gave the Ring a will of its own. However, once Sauron's intentions\nwere revealed to him, he stole the One Ring and used it to command an\narmy of orcs and Uruks to fight Sauron and lay claim over Mordor. In a\nfinal battle, Celebrimbor used the Ring's power of invisibility to\ndefeat Sauron. However the ring wanted to return to the Dark Lord, and\nso it slipped off of Celebrimbor's finger and onto Sauron's, breaking\nCelebrimbor's control over his orc army. Captured by Sauron, the elf was\nthen tortured as punishment, such as witnessing his family tortured and\nkilled in front of him, before finally being beaten to death with his\nown Mithril hammer by Sauron.\n\n\n\nWhen the game takes place and the protagonist, Talion, is slain in a\nblood-ritual, Celebrimbor is bound to the ranger, which allows Talion to\nreturn from the dead (in addition to many other abilities). He has no\nmemory of his past, not even remembering his own name until they find an\nartifact that belonged to him (with the assistance of Gollum,) and with\neach artifact they find more of his memory is restored. Gollum\neventually abandons them, leaving them to find the last artifact in Udûn\non their own. They also assist a low ranking captain named Ratbag\nadvance through the ranks until he advances to Warchief, and kill all\nother warchiefs (leaving Ratbag in charge of all the uruks in Udûn),\nwhich leads to his demise after he is blamed for failing to prevent the\ndestruction of a monument to Sauron by the Hammer of Sauron, a Black\nCaptain and a lieutenant of the Black Hand of Sauron (the leader of the\nuruks in Sauron's stead). Talion (and Celebrimbor) is approached by\nLithariel, the daughter of the Queen of the Tribesmen of Núrnen, who\nclaims her mother has summoned Talion to her chambers.\n\nTheir job finished in Udûn, they make their way to Núrnen and have an\naudience with Queen Marwen (who looks similar to King Théoden when he\nwas enchanted by Saruman), who gives them another artifact from\nCelebrimbor's past.\n\nThis artifact gives the wraith and his host their key to confronting the\nBlack Hand: branding. They begin building their army by branding the\ncaptains and warchiefs of Núrnen (and optionally Udûn), thus enabling\nthem to confront the Black Hand at his fortress of Ered Glamhoth, the\nstrength of his forces depending on how many warchiefs and captains he\nbranded. They return to the queen to tell her they are prepared to leave\nwhen suddenly the Queen begins forcing Celebrimbor out of Talion, saying\nthat they can defeat Sauron “together.” As Talion dies, he tells\nLithariel, Marwen's daughter, to break the Queen's staff, and when it\nbreaks, the Queen becomes youthful again, and reveals she went to the\nIstari Saruman for assistance in helping her people survive Sauron's\nonslaught. Celebrimbor suspects that Saruman may have gone rogue, and\nmay be desiring the One for himself. Marwen nonetheless assists Talion\nby acquiring them a smuggler, which they use to go to the Black Hand's\nfortress.\n\nWhen Talion enters the fortress, a skeleton bound to a pole by rope\nbegins talking directly to Talion, and Celebrimbor reveals that the\nTower of Sauron, another Black Captain and the Black Hand's right hand,\nis responsible for this, and thus is here in the Black Hand's stead.\nTalion approaches the Black Hand's throne, and as he looks for the\nTower, the Black Captain appears in the throne, and reveals the Black\nHand went looking for Talion. He addresses Celebrimbor directly, telling\nhim Sauron forgives him and, if he casts off that “corpse” and becomes\none with him, he will have his dreams fulfilled. Celebrimbor rebukes the\nTower, saying that Talion and the wraith will never surrender.\n\nFailing to deceive Celebrimbor, he reveals to Talion that the Ringmaker\ndeceived Talion by pretending that the Black Hand of Sauron placed a\ncurse on them, binding them together, where in reality Cerebrimbor chose\nTalion as his “host” and could have released him at any time. Talion\ninsists that the Tower stand up and fight, to which the Tower obliges.\nHe creates illusions of himself, forcing Talion to drain the illusions\nto sap the Tower of his power.\n\nAfter the illusions are eliminated, Talion hears his wife Ioreth\nsinging, and when he gets close to her, his wife is revealed as the\nTower, who attempts to brand Talion. However, the ranger overpowers him\nand brutally kills him, stabbing him with his son's dagger, Acharn, four\ntimes in the heart, before shoving his sword, Urafel, into the Tower's\nlaughing mouth. After the Tower's death, Talion reveals his anger at\nCelebrimbor for his deceit, saying he wanted to be with his wife and son\ninstead of being alone alive. Celebrimbor points out though that the\nranger wanted revenge, and thus he gave him the means to do so. The\nRingmaker does admit that he can leave Talion, if he wants. Yet before\nthey can part ways, the wraith says that they must finish what they\nstarted by killing their true target: the Black Hand. Talion reluctantly\nagrees, and the pair set sail for Núrnen once more.\n\nHowever, they find the Queen's palace sacked, and blood on the throne.\nThe queen's crown, however, was left, and when Talion picks it up,\nanother set of Celebrimbor's memories are returned to him. They figure\nthe Black Hand has them in Udûn, preparing an exchange for Celebrimbor\nfor the Queen and her daughter. They arrive in the now-dark, ashed\nfilled Udûn, where they find the Black Hand's elite guards standing\nwatch for the duo. When the Talion arrives at the Black Gate riding a\nCaragor, his branded Uruks and warchiefs are already fighting the rank\nand file Uruks. Then finally, with a warchief and a set of captains, the\nTalons of the Black Hand reveal themselves, along with a host of rank\nand file uruks. To Talion's sadness, The Talons reveal that they\nslaughtered all of the Núrnen tribesman, including Lithariel and Queen\nMarwen. After a brutal fight, the Talons are defeated, and the remaining\nbranded Uruks that assisted Talion remain behind to fight the Black\nHand's forces. Meanwhile, the Gravewalker climbs the Black Gate, and\nfind the Black Hand waiting for him. Then quite subtly, the Black\nCaptain lures the wraith duo in and unleashes a blast of energy that\ngives Celebrimbor more of his memories: his confrontation with Sauron in\nthe fields of Udûn ending in failure, the return of Sauron's ring, and\nthe brutal murders of Celebrimbor's family before his eyes, before being\nmurdered himself. This gives Celebrimbor more power as a result. The\nBlack Hand tells Celebrimbor that when he originally performed the blood\nritual in an attempt to absorb his spirit into the Black Hand's\ncorporeal form (thus reforming an avatar of Sauron, though he would not\nbe at full strength), he gave him a choice: to stand by Sauron's side.\nHe then tells the gravewalker duo that Talion and Celebrimbor have no\nchoice in the matter, and surprisingly performs the blood ritual on\nhimself, absorbing Celebrimbor into the Black Hand and forming the\navatar of Sauron. Sauron tries to kill the already dying Talion, but as\nSauron is about to deliver the finishing blow, Celebrimbor uses his\nenergy to temporarily stun Sauron. This gives Talion the chance he\nneeded to kill the avatar of Sauron, and thus the Black Hand, with his\nsword.\n\nTalion relieved that he has finally exacted vengeance for his family,\nsees Celebrimbor waiting, ready to go to the afterlife together. Talion,\nhowever, insists that together they should use their powers to combat\nSauron, because they both know as long as his Ring exists, he will\nreturn again, no matter in what form. Celebrimbor insists that fighting\nSauron is mortally impossible, because he tried once long ago and it\ncouldn't be done. Talion asks the Ringmaker if he could die knowing\nthere was chance that they could defeat Sauron, but they didn't take it.\nCelebrimbor simply disappears, and doesn't answer. Talion, looking at\nUdûn's red sun, declares to himself and the wraith that it's time for\nthem to forge new ring, as his eyes glow with the wraith's power.\n\nThe two then travel to Mount Doom, and proceed to forge a new ring. Upon\nit's completion, Celebrimbor is separated from Talion by Shelob, and\nTalion takes the new ring to survive without the wraith. He later finds\nhim in Shelob's lair within Cirith Ungol, and gives her the new ring in\nexchange for Celebrimbor. The elven wraith dislikes this exchange\nhowever, but Shelob's natural powers amplified by the ring prove to be\ntoo strong to fight, and thus the duo shifts their attention to a new\ntarget; The Palantíri in Minas Ithil.\n\nAfter the city's eventual fall, Sauron sends 8 ringwraiths to force the\nnew ring from Shelob. Realizing the danger that keeping the ring would\ncause to both her and to Middle-earth, she returns the ring to it's\nforgers. The ranger and the wraith then proceed to Nurnen, where they\nuse the ring's power to build an army and take over the region;\nSubsequently, they are betrayed by an ally in the process, only to exact\nrevenge on him with utter cruelty. Of course, Celebrimbor's cruelty\nhints to Talion that the ring's power is starting to affect the elf's\nsanity.\n\n\n\nEventually, after conquering most of Sauron's domain, defeating a Balrog\nwith the help of Carnan, a nature spirit, and finding out the identities\nof some of the Nazgul, the duo takes their army and march towards\nBarad-dûr, only to be stopped by one of the ringwraiths, Isildur. Upon\nhis defeat, Talion decides to end the fallen hero's torment, and\npermanently kills him. However, Celebrimbor considers this an act of\nbetrayal; he reveals that his plan has gone from simple revenge to\ntyranny, as he plans on brainwashing Sauron and ruling Middle-earth\nthrough him. As Talion objects to this plan, the wraith abandons the\nranger's body and takes over Eltariel's, leaving Talion to bleed to\ndeath.\n\nAs Talion picks up Isildur's ring, he becomes a ringwraith and decided\nto take back Minas Morgul, whilst Celebrimbor and his new host face\nSauron. Eventually, Sauron, in his Annatar form, finds himself on his\nknees, and Celebrimbor begins to brand him. Sauron pulls out a blade and\nslices off Eltariel's fingers, just like Isildur had done to him\ncenturies earlier. With Sauron now having the upper hand, he consumes\nthe wraith, but with adverse effects; they both become the flaming eye\nof Sauron, locked into a battle off wills. The two fought until the One\nRing was destroyed in the War of the Ring, wherein the Dark Lord Sauron\nwas finally defeated.\n\nHowever, Celebrimbor did not fade from middle-earth as Sauron did, for,\nlike Sauron, he had poured his own life force into his own ring. Thus,\nCelebrimbor was freed and the New Ring, now worn by the Elven assassin\nEltariel, started expressing a desire to return to it's creator...\n\nCelebrimbor is voiced by Alastair Duncan.",

    "text": "FËANOR was a Ñoldorin elf and one of the Elven kindred that departed\nfrom Valinor in the land of Aman, where they had lived with the Valar.\n\nHe was born in Valinor, the only child of Finwë, High King of the\nÑoldor, and Finwë's first wife Míriel Therindë. He was renowned as a\ncraftsman, gem-smith, and warrior, the maker of the Silmarils and\ninventor of the Tengwar script. He was also the creator of the seven\nPalantíri. He was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind; of\nbeauty, understanding, skill, and subtlety, of all the Children of\nIlúvatar. However, his personality was riddled with flaws, foremost\namong them selfishness and pride, that ultimately led to him causing his\npeople untold anguish.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nFëanor drew so much of Míriel's life energy when he was born that she\ngrew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving\nher family for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finwë remarried and\nhad four more children; Fëanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin,\nand half-sisters Findis and Irimë. Though he loved his father as dearly\nas a son could, Fëanor was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her\nchildren, and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his\nyouth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship\nand language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Rúmil and\ncreated the system of writing known as Tengwar. He also became a student\nof Mahtan, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë\nhimself. From Mahtan, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point\nhe wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel, who bore him seven sons: Maedhros,\nMaglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras. He spent most of\nhis time either alone or with his sons, and they were all completely\nloyal to him. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much\nof Aman as he could and constantly crafting new works.\n\nThe Making of the Silmarils\n\nBy far the greatest of Fëanor's crafting achievements was the creation\nof the _Silmarils_, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, Fëanor\ncaptured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of Valinor\nand, by unknown means, locked it into three large diamond-like gems. His\ncreations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Silmarils\nabove all else. However, as time went on, he began to covet the gems\nwith a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light\nwhich lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own\nmaking. Fëanor alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and\njealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though\neventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under\nlock and key.\n\nThe Wiles of Morgoth\n\n\n\nAfter three ages of imprisonment, Melkor, the mightiest of the Valar and\nthe world's primordial source of evil, deceived the Valar with a false\nshow of repentance. Pardoned and residing in Valinor, his malice had in\nfact reached hitherto unprecedented level, and its primary target\nquickly became the Elves, as it had been for their sake that he had been\noverthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of Elves in\nValinor, the Ñoldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst\nfor knowledge and willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on\nthe Ñoldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that the Valar were\nkeeping them imprisoned in Valinor so that the race of Men might inherit\nMiddle-earth and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although\nFëanor mistrusted and feared Melkor, in his arrogance and impatience he\noften unwittingly repeated the lies of Melkor. He quickly became the\nmost prominent of the rebellious Ñoldor, to the point where the other\nValar, not knowing of Melkor's lies, saw him as the source of the\nÑoldor's distemper.\n\nMelkor coveted the Silmarils and hated Fëanor, but he hid his intentions\nfrom the Ñoldor and the Valar as the situation continued to deteriorate.\nMelkor's lies eventually came to the point where rumors began to\ncirculate amongst some that Fëanor's half-brother Fingolfin was planning\nnot only to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also to seize the\nSilmarils for himself. In his pride and vanity, Fëanor took little\nconvincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened\nFingolfin with violence. The Valar, having put up with Fëanor's\nrabble-rousing for some time, could not ignore the transgression of\nbreaking the peace of Valinor and so summoned Fëanor to the Ring of Doom\nto explain himself. Fëanor's testimony revealed the malice of Melkor and\nhis lies, and Tulkas immediately left the Ring to apprehend him again.\nDespite Melkor having been the true root of the Ñoldor's unrest,\nFëanor's crime had been of his own making, and for this the Valar exiled\nhim to Formenos. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the\nSilmarils, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his\neldest son, Finwë also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship\nso long as Fëanor remained in exile.\n\n\n\nSome time later, Melkor unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried\nto sway Fëanor to his side, proclaiming that the Valar had treated him\nunjustly. However, Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain\nthe Silmarils, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Vala. Melkor left\nin a rage and fled from Valinor. He feigned to go north, but ultimately\nturned south, passing as a cloud to the unexplored southern coast of\nAman. The Valar later sought to mend the breach between Fëanor and\nFingolfin, and invited them to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered\na hand to his half-brother, recognizing Fëanor's place as the eldest,\nbut it was returned by Fëanor somewhat grudgingly.\n\nRape of the Silmarils\n\nMelkor stole away to Avathar in the south of Aman. There he discovered\nthe evil spider-like creature Ungoliant and secured her as an ally,\npromising that her unrelenting hunger would be satisfied in return for\nher aid. During the festivities at which Fëanor and Fingolfin had\nreconciled, Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees and plunged\nValinor into complete darkness. Melkor and Ungoliant then went to\nFormenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and ransacked the vault, taking the\nSilmarils and many other treasures. They then escaped by crossing the\nHelcaraxë, or Grinding Ice, in the north to Beleriand in Middle-earth.\nThough the Valar attempted pursuit, it was ultimately in vain, for the\nUnlight of Ungoliant completely obscured the sight of the pursuers.\n\nThe Valar quickly realized that with the Trees dead, their light\nsurvived only in the Silmarils. To restore the Trees and foil Melkor's\nmalice, Yavanna asked Fëanor to give up the Silmarils so that they could\nbe broken, and the light within them released. But Fëanor emphatically\nstated that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will, and\nproclaimed that if the Valar forced him to do so that they would be no\nbetter than Melkor. Ultimately however, Fëanor's selfishness made little\ndifference, for a messenger from Formenos then arrived to deliver the\nnews of Finwë's death and the loss of the Silmarils.\n\nThe Flight of the Ñoldor\n\n\n\nFëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized\nSilmarils, named Melkor “Morgoth”, or “Black Foe of the World”\n(literally “Black Enemy”). As he did so, a great rage and despair\ngripped him, for his love for his father had run deep, and he fled in\ngrief from the Ring of Doom. Now King of the Ñoldor after the death of\nhis father, Fëanor returned to Tirion, ignoring the fact that he was\nstill technically exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches\never delivered in Arda. However, due to his rage, grief, and pride, he\nunwittingly filled his speech with many of the lies and half-truths of\nMorgoth. He railed against the Dark Lord, but he also blamed the Valar\nin part for Morgoth's deeds, claiming that they should have been able to\nstop him and had failed. He spoke of the fact that because Morgoth had\nattacked and badly marred the kingdom of the Valar without consequence\nto himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in\nAman any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build\nin Middle-earth, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained\nthe Silmarils. Fëanor then swore an oath by the name of Ilúvatar himself\nthat he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold\na Silmaril from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who\nattempted it. The Oath of Fëanor was also taken by his seven sons below\nthe tower of the Mindon Eldaliéva in the Great Square of Tirion. This\noath was the cause for great tragedy for Fëanor's family, and for the\nEldar in general.\n\nHis impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his\ntremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should\nlead the hosts to Middle-earth. For though Fëanor was technically High\nKing, he was not well liked amongst the Ñoldor, and many of them were\nnot of mind to accept him as king. Greater love was given to Fingolfin\nand his sons, and most of the Ñoldor desired greatly that Fingolfin and\nhis sons should go with them and lead them. Fingolfin was not eager to\ngo, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and\nfurthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of Fëanor's\nrash and often selfish courses of action. Additionally, his son Fingon\nwas eager to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come with\nhim. Thus against his wisdom, Fingolfin marched with a second and larger\nhost than Fëanor, while Finarfin commanded a third, smaller, and quite\nreluctant host. However even with the three sons of Finwë leading the\nway, about a tenth of the Ñoldor chose simply to stay in Tirion, some\nfor the love of Tirion and others for love of the Valar.\n\nThe First Kinslaying\n\n\n\nAfter delivering his speech and departing with his host, Fëanor's mood\ncooled somewhat and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means\nof delivering himself and his people to Middle-earth. For though\nMiddle-earth and Aman were connected in those days by the Helcaraxë, a\ntreacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was\ndeemed to be impassable. Fëanor then gave thought to the building of\nships, but there were no shipwrights amongst the Ñoldor and even had\nthere been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of his people to\nMiddle-earth would have been a monumental and time consuming task.\nFëanor therefore went to Alqualondë where the seafaring Teleri lived and\nattempted to persuade them to join him, or failing that, secure the use\nof their ships. But the Teleri had no desire whatsoever to leave Aman\nand would not give Fëanor their ships, for they held them too dearly.\nFëanor angrily cited that the Teleri owed the Ñoldor for instructing\nthem in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olwë, the lord of\nthe Teleri, was unmoved, and rebuffed again in friendship what he saw as\ngreat folly by Fëanor and his kin.\n\nBut Fëanor would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of\nhis people had been inflamed by his impassioned words, and knew that\nhaste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the Ñoldor to a\nmore reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in\ntaking the ships by force. This he attempted, and the Teleri resisted,\ncasting many of the the Ñoldor into the sea and thrice driving them back\ndespite being far more lightly armed than the Ñoldor. However,\nFingolfin's host, which had been slower and less eager to start the\njourney, came upon the battle in progress. Believing that the Teleri had\nbeen the aggressors, perhaps on the orders of the Valar themselves,\nFingolfin's host came to the aid of his brother's and the Teleri were\novercome. The ships were stolen, and many of the Teleri mariners were\nwickedly slain. After commandeering the ships, the Ñoldor, their hosts\nlessened by battle and by terrible storms conjured by Ossë in vengeance\nfor the Teleri, encountered a figure that may have been Mandos himself.\nThis figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the Ñoldor from Valinor and\nforetelling that their war against Morgoth would cause them only misery.\nDue to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly\nforsaken in the eyes of the Valar, and would receive neither welcome nor\naid from Valinor in their struggles. Additionally, Fëanor and his house\nwere cursed, and Mandos foretold great suffering and hardship would be\ntheir lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the\nSilmarils at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear\nthat any war made by the Ñoldor against Morgoth would be utterly\nhopeless, for the Ñoldor, being Elves, did not have the power to\novercome a Vala. Hearing this Doom, and having not participated in the\nKinslaying, Finarfin and his host and turned back in grief, cursing\nFëanor. They were pardoned and accepted by the Valar, and\nFinarfin ruled as High-King of the Ñoldor in Tirion. Fëanor, however,\ndefied the Doom and proceeded onward. As such the journey northward\ncontinued, the land became ever darker, and the temperatures began to\ndrop dramatically as the Ñoldor began to approached the Helcaraxë. Many\nof the Ñoldor, already reluctant to follow Fëanor, began to openly\nexpress dissatisfaction with his actions as conditions continued to\ndeteriorate. Fëanor was all too aware of this and sought counsel with\nhis sons. For despite having succeeded in seizing the Teleri fleet, the\nstorms of Ossë had wreaked many of the ships, and there were no longer\nenough to bear all of the Ñoldor at once to Middle-earth. But due to\nfear of treachery, none were willing to be left in Aman while others\ncrossed the sea first.\n\n\n\nHowever, Fëanor's most loyal forces had maintained control of the Teleri\nfleet after having seized it. As the dissent grew worse, Fëanor decided\nto simply abandon all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and\nhe and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived\nat Losgar, in the land of Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where\nMorgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, and upon arriving,\nFëanor decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin\nbehind. The earth, being flat in those days, allowed the remaining\nÑoldor to see the flames, and they perceived that they were betrayed.\nFingolfin now had the choice of either returning to Tirion in disgrace,\nor proceeding to Middle-earth across the treacherous Helcaraxë.\nFingolfin and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of\nFingolfin's host wished to continue and many, including Fingolfin\nhimself, were eager to confront Fëanor and his people over their\nbetrayal. The journey was a long and terrible one, and Fingolfin's host\nsuffered great losses along the way, which added to the bitterness they\nfelt for Fëanor and his sons.\n\nFinal Battle and Death\n\nLearning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his\nfortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This\nconfrontation was called the Battle under the Stars, or\n_Dagor-nuin-Giliath_, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The\nÑoldor won the battle handily, and destroyed Morgoth's armies. But\nFëanor, exhilarated by the victory and ever prideful, pressed on toward\nAngband far ahead of his army with only a small vanguard. As he\napproached Angband, the Orcs, seeing that Fëanor's numbers were so few,\nturned and gave battle. Due to their proximity to Angband, they were\nreinforced by a number of Balrogs, who quickly slew most of the Elves.\nBut Fëanor was undaunted, and though he was dealt many wounds, he long\nfought on alone. At last however, he was stricken to the ground by\nGothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs. [] Fortunately for Fëanor, his sons\narrived with a substantial relief force. The Balrogs returned to\nAngband, and Fëanor's sons took him from the battlefield. However,\nFëanor knew that his wounds were mortal, and bade his sons to stop. He\nlooked upon Angband and cursed Morgoth thrice, but gazing upon the sheer\nscope of Morgoth's stronghold, he understood at last the truth of\nMandos's words; that no force of the Ñoldor would ever overthrow the\nDark Lord. Nevertheless, he instructed his sons to keep to their oath\nand avenge their father. As he died, his fiery spirit left his body and\nburned it to ash.\n\nLegacy\n\nOn Fëanor's passing, his son Maedhros became High King of the Ñoldor.\nMaedhros, however, met Fingolfin soon after and gave the kingship to him\nout of respect, a desire to keep his people united, and an\nacknowledgment that, as Finwë's oldest surviving son, the kingship ought\nto pass to him by right of birth. Fingolfin's descendents would\nreign over the Nôldor until the death of Gil-galad many centuries later.\nFëanor's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow\nover the interactions between the Silvan Elves and the returning Ñoldor.\nFor Thingol, the King of Doriath, eventually learned of the kinslaying,\nthe burning of the ships at Losgar, and the curse of Mandos. As the\nTeleri were of Thingol's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the\nmerciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Finarfin he came to\nforgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the\nevil. Those of Fingolfin's host, who had endured the horror of crossing\nthe Helcaraxë after Fëanor's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough\nhardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed Fëanor,\nwere of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Thingol held in contempt\nand would have as little to do with as he could. Fëanor's remaining sons\nwere still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, and this oath\nwould eventually see two more Kinslayings come to pass, each more\nhorrific than the last, and would work to undermine the Elven war\nagainst Morgoth in many important ways. The Doors of Durin would later\nbear the emblem of the House of Fëanor: a single star with many rays.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nOriginally named _Finwë_ or _Finweminya_ after his father, and later\n_CURUFINWË_ (“Skillful  Finwë”), he was the greatest of the\nÑoldor, and very briefly their king. His name is a compromise between\nthe Sindarin _Faenor_ and the Quenya _FËANÁRO_, meaning “Spirit of\nfire”.",

    "name": "Bilbo Baggins",
    "race": "Hobbits",
    "text": "BILBO BAGGINS was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of ''The\nHobbit ''and a secondary character in ''The Lord of the Rings. ''\n\nGandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and Company to be\ntheir burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of\nthe Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and\nthe first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He\nwrote many of his adventures in a book he called _There and Back Again_.\nBilbo adopted Frodo Baggins as his nephew after his parents, Drogo\nBaggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.\n\nBilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and\nwas one of the few to visit the The Undying Lands across the ocean.\n\n*He is possibly named after a type of sword popularly used in the 16th\ncentury (which is also called Bilbo)\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nBilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around\nSeptember 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He\nwas the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.\n\n\n\nIn Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious\nHobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved\nto their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.\n\nAs a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside\nworld. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality\nin Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember\nGandalf's Fireworks displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at\nGreat Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his\nyouth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent\ndown to pick up a rock.\n\nWhen Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively,\nBilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone\nin Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy\nbachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors\nadmired.\n\nQuest of Erebor\n\nAn Unexpected Journey\n\nIn the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf and\nthirteen dwarves (The Unexpected Party), led by Thorin Oakenshield.\nThese Dwarves wished to hire Bilbo as their burglar on their quest to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo reluctantly\nagreed to go, and the next morning they set off from _The Green Dragon\nInn_.\n\n\n\nThorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and\nbeside castles. After approximately one month, Gandalf disappeared. Oín\nand Gloín failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted\na fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo\nto investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and\nWilliam. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring\nback to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first class burglar. However,\nhe was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all\nthe dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him.\nFortunately, Gandalf came in the nick of time and saved them all by\nimitating the Trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with\none another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone. After\nrescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the trolls'\ncave, which the latter used to hide their treasure and shield themselves\nfrom the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons\nwere found, _Glamdring_ (Beater) and _Orcrist_ (Biter) among them. Bilbo\ntook an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a\nsmall knife in size, which he would later name _Sting_. He kept it with\nhim for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.\n\nIn June they came to Rivendell. During their visit Bilbo met Elrond, and\nbecame enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the\nswords of Thorin and Gandalf, and looked at Thrór's Map. Elrond\nexplained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named Orcrist\nand Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon letters that\nspoke of the back door of Erebor, which read: _Stand by the grey stone\nwhen the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of\nDurin's Day will shine upon the keyhole._\n\nDiscovery of the One Ring\n\nBilbo and his companions then travelled from Rivendell and made their\nway to the Misty Mountains. It was here the companions encountered and\nfled from the Great Goblin and his immense forces. Bilbo, unfortunately,\nlost direction during the struggle and fell into a gaping hole within\nthe mountains. Luckily, he survived the fall and crawled his way through\nthe pitch-black tunnel, using his hobbit nose to gain a sense of\ndirection. Bilbo eventually stumbled upon a small ring, but thought\nnothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know\nit, this lost trinket was the One Ring, forged by Sauron many years ago.\nBilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the Ring\nfor over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a game of\nriddles with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if Bilbo\nwon. However, Gollum was not satisfied with Bilbo's final riddle, and\nwhile mourning his loss, found that his Ring was gone. Gollum then\npaddled back on his boat towards Bilbo, who he then accused of stealing\nhis precious, but Bilbo had vanished.\n\n\n\nGollum, thinking Bilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to\nthe exit and was followed by Bilbo. Bilbo was soon reunited with his\ncompanions. Bilbo and the travellers had stopped for the night when\ngoblins and a pack of wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The\ndwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the\ngoblins were not going to leave without killing them. They started to\nburn the trees down. The Warg Chieftain was ordering the other wargs\naround when Gandalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it\nablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting The Warg Chieftain. It\nrolled around on the ground burning while Gandalf threw more and more\npinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by\neagles. When an eagle grabbed Dori, Bilbo had to jump and grab Dori's\nlegs before he was forgotten. This prompted Bilbo to groan “My arms! My\npoor arms,” and Dori to cry, “My legs! My poor legs!” The eagles\neventually took them to their eyrie where they rested and continued\ntheir journey.\n\n\n\nThe group traveled to Beorn's house where they rested, after being\ngruffly taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned their\nstory and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn\nalso lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood.\nHowever, Beorn did not fully trust the dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn\ngiving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. Eventually\nthe company reached Mirkwood, where the ponies were let go (to several\nof the dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning\nthem, “Do not stray off the path.”\n\nThe Company began to follow the path through the treacherous forest.\nEventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send\nBilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree,\nwhere a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only\nsaw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not\nsee that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the dwarves,\nwhere they met the news with ill comfort, angry that the dwarves were\nfatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or\nsee the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The\nCompany then came upon the Enchanted River. Bilbo saw a boat on the\nother side, leading the dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of\nnowhere when all the dwarves were on the other side. A dwarf shot it\nwhere it died, on the other side. The dwarves hoped for venison for\ndinner when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The dwarves fished\nhim out, where he was asleep, but the boat was knocked away, ending the\nhope for venison.\n\nWhile wandering down the path, the dwarves saw lights in the forest.\nDeciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they\nheaded after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went\nout and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the\nthird time all of them fell asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the dwarves for\nleaving the path and discovered that spiders had captured his\ncompanions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through\nthe cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted\nthe spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate the\nspiders, who left their domain to find the insulter and eat him. Bilbo\nkilled a few by throwing stones at a few spiders and he killed more via\nSting. They never found him, since he used the Ring to turn invisible.\nAfter freeing the dwarves, he led them into a charge against the\nspiders, where Bilbo killed dozens of the arachnids with the help of the\nRing and Sting.\n\nAfter traveling through Mirkwood Forest the dwarves were taken prisoner\nby Wood-elves, who believed that the company had “assaulted” the elves\nwhile they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the\nforest). Bilbo avoided being caught by using his ring to stay invisible,\nand followed them into the halls of the elf-king where they were held\ncaptive. Eventually Bilbo was able to rescue the dwarves and soon they\nall arrived at Lake Town, a small town occupied by men where Smaug would\nfrequently attack, though he had not been seen in many years. The group\nsearched the mountainside until they found the secret door. Bilbo alone\nwas sent in to steal some treasure from Smaug. When he arrived, Smaug\nwas awake and sensed his presence. Bilbo put on the ring so as to avoid\nbeing noticed.\n\nSmaug tried to figure out who or what Bilbo was, but Bilbo would not\ntell Smaug his true identity, answering Smaug's questions only in\nriddles. While invisible, Bilbo saw that Smaug had a bare spot on his\njewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, Bilbo removed the ring and Smaug\nsaw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage.\nAfter Bilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, the dragon flew off to\nLaketown. Bilbo told a thrush to send word to Bard of Smaug's weakness.\nBard shot the Black Arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending\nhim to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying part of Lake Town.\n\nBattle of Five Armies and aftermath\n\nIn Lake Town, after Thorin Oakenshield reclaimed the mountain, the\nBattle of the Five Armies took place. Beorn, the Beorning chieftain,\njoined the travellers in their fight against an army of orcs. After the\nbattle, Bilbo found Thorin lying on a bed, dying. Thorin praised Bilbo\nand apologized to him for cursing him earlier.\n\nAfter Thorin's funeral, Dain offered him his one-fourteenth share of the\ntreasure, but Bilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with\ngold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the\nwood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo\ntraveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's\nhouse with Gandalf. Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom,\nand William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure\nthe dwarves had buried earlier, most of which Bilbo offered to Gandalf\nto use to aid the peoples of Middle-Earth. Bilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he\nfound an auction taking place in which his relatives, the\nSackville-Bagginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his\npossessions to the other hobbits. The Sackville-Bagginses were vexed to\nsee Bilbo alive, since they wanted to live in Bag End themselves. Bilbo\nhad to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with\nthem. Eventually, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the\ncurrent news of Middle-earth.\n\nReturn in the Shire\n\nAlthough Bilbo returned safely to Bag End with his reward and lived in\nrelative comfort, Bilbo’s life was not quite the same as it had once\nbeen. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of\nthe neighbors’ respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and\nthere was much talk and false rumors circulated about his affairs and\ndoings. The worst of these problems came from the Sackville-Bagginses,\nwho were angry that they were not able to possess Bag End when he was\nthought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when Bilbo adopted\nhis nephew Frodo (a Brandybuck) as his heir apparent.\n\nBilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the\nSackville-Bagginses as much as he could, even using the Ring once to\nhide from them. Bilbo was very generous with his money and most people\nwere willing to forgive him his oddities. He had many friends especially\namongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on\nthe growing of vegetables. His good friend The Gaffer even allowed him\nto tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo taught him to read and write, and\nat some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of\nthe elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and\nsheltered life at Bag End.\n\n\n\nBilbo was the bearer of the One Ring for six decades, ignorant of its\nsignificance. However, by TA 3001, the Ring had begun to affect him. He\ndid not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin\ninside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one more adventure,\nbefore he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the\nQuest for the Lonely Mountain.\n\n\n\nOn September 22, a farewell Birthday Party was held in his honour, where\nhe announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his\nfamily and friends. Immediately afterwards, he put on his ring and\ndisappeared, as a joke on his neighbours. He returned to his house where\nhe was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to\nleave the ring for Frodo. Bilbo initially agreed, but then became\nhostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own\nbenefit, which he referred to as his “precious.” Horrified by Bilbo's\noutburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it\nbehind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologising and\nadmitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. After a moment of\ninner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming\nthe first ring-bearer to give up the ring on his own will. Bilbo and\nGandalf bade each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his\njourney.\n\nOn the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the\npossession of his relative, Frodo Baggins who was eager to be his own\nmaster despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the\nShire. After his departure, Bilbo wandered to Rivendell and then, after\na rest, accompanied some dwarves to Dale, before returning to Rivendell.\n\nLife in Rivendell\n\n\n\nBetween TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his\nadventures, in a book that would later be known as the _Red Book of\nWestmarch_. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a\nthree-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called _Translations\nfrom the Elvish_. He composed the poem _All that is Gold Does Not\nGlitter_ for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about Eärendil during\nhis stay at Rivendell.\n\nIn October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learnt that his\nnephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring so he gave him the sword\nSting and for protection his mithril shirt. However, he remained in\nRivendell while Frodo travelled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had\nnoticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effect, although he\ncontinued to desire it.\n\n\n\nSince Bilbo had been a ring-bearer, he was allowed to accompany Frodo to\nthe Undying Lands. On September 22, 3021, Bilbo turned 131, and became\nthe oldest Hobbit in Middle-earth (unless Sméagol is counted to have\nremained a Hobbit). On September 29, he, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and\nFrodo boarded a ship docked at the Grey Havens and sailed away from\nMiddle-earth. His fate afterwards is not known but as he too was a\nmortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of\nValinor.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nBilbo was a very friendly and well-mannered hobbit fond of food, drink,\na full pipe, his friends and good cheer, and was known for greeting\nstrangers and friends with hospitality saying; “At your service and your\nfamilies”. Being related to both the Tooks and the Baggins two family\ngroups that were fundamentally opposite in their mentalities, with the\nTooks being more fond of adventures and wandering, and the Baggins who\nwere more fond of the settled life, Bilbo had two different sides to\nhim, something he referred to as the “Took side” and the “Baggins side”.\nThis meant that he secretly relished having adventures but still wanted\nto remain settled and was very afraid.\nBilbo seemed to be happy with his life at Bag End, and would have been\ncontent to remain a child of his father, had adventure not come upon\nhim. Still very afraid and wishing he had never left his hobbit-hole,\nthe Took side eventually won out, even after he returned home to his old\nlife. Thus, his desire for another adventure never truly departed from\nhim in his heart even into his old age. This he demonstrated in his\nsudden departure from Bag End in TA 3001.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nOther names\n\n-   Bur-a-hobbit\n-   The Barrel Rider\n-   Burglar\n-   Thief in the Shadows\n-   Child of the kindly West\n-   Clue-finder\n-   Guest of Eagles\n-   The Lucky Number\n-   Luckwearer\n-   Old Mad Baggins\n-   The Ring Winner\n-   The Spider Stinger\n-   Stinging Fly\n-   He that walks unseen\n-   Mr. Boggins\n-   The Web Cutter\n\nEarlier names\n\n-   Bilba Labingi, the original hobbit name for Bilbo\n\n\nBilbo's writings\n\n\n\nTranslations\n\n-   _Translations from the Elvish_\n-   _The Fall of Gil-galad_\n\nComposed works\n\n-   _There and Back Again_\n-   _The Road Goes Ever On_\n-   _All that is Gold Does Not Glitter_\n-   _Song of Eärendil_\n-   _The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late_\n-   _A Walking Song_ (Wrote the lyrics)\n-   _Warning of Winter_\n-   _Bilbo's Last Song_\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Lord of the Rings_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Return of the King_.",

    "text": "FRODO BAGGINS, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during\nthe Third Age. He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character\nfor his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One\nRing to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best\nfriend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who\nsailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third\nAge.\n\n\nBiography\n\nChildhood\n\nMuch of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the\nancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula\nBrandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending\nMeriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing\ntrouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer\nMaggot's farm Bamfurlong.  \n\nIn TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a\nboating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in\nBrandy Hall until his 99-year-old “uncle” Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989.\nBilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him\nhis heir.\n\n\n\nThe two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of\nthe Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the\nlore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by\nShire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party\nof special magnificence was held at the beginning of The Fellowship of\nthe Ring when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the\npeculiar year of 111.\n\nBilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his\nfellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf\nquickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where\nBilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and\ndisgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.\n\nBefore departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long\nconversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily\nsurrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a\nnote for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.\n\nComing of Age and Quest Beginning\n\n\n\nAfter the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was\nnow the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring.\nGandalf, ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose\n(but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit\nagainst the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied\nwith the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on\nApril 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the\nRing was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord Sauron needed to\nrule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the\nRing, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to\nRivendell.\n\nAfter Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was\nrunning out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was\nencouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at\nCrickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had\nagreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of\nthe Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the\nSackville-Baggins, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his\nfiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and\nPippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as\nSauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire\ndressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.\n\nTo Bree\n\nFrodo was unable to find much information about his pursuers from his\nconversations with the High Elves and Farmer Maggot, but what they were\ntold was less than encouraging. When Frodo arrived at Buckland, where\nMerry was waiting, he found that Merry and Pippin already knew about\nFrodo's “secret” journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to\nbring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and\nthe Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed.\nThey met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man\nWillow and the Barrow-Wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a\nmysterious being who dwelled in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.\n\nStrider\n\n\n\nIn Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went\nby the name of Mr. Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as\npossible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the\nshadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper,\nBarliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man,\na Ranger, as Strider.\n\nThat night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search\nof Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits\nfrom them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself\nas Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the\nbackstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a\npony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo\nand his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to\nRivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to\nthe top of Weathertop.\n\nWeathertop\n\n\n\nOn the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of\nthe nine Ringwraiths at the hill of Weathertop. In the presence of the\nNazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to\nresist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the\nname of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader\nof the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder\n(he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-blade. If it had caught\nhim in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker\nand under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the\nappearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had\ntorches, one of their few weaknesses.\n\nThough Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A\nfragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it\ncontinued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was\nrescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his\nhorse, named Asfaloth. They were pursued by the Nazgûl as Asfaloth\ncarried Frodo to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of\nRivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, Frodo turned and saw\nthe Nine Ringwraiths on the other side. They ordered him to give up the\nRing, but Frodo refused.\n\n\n\nSubsequently, the Ringwraiths were washed away in a flood called up by\nElrond, the leader of Rivendell. He was healed in Rivendell by Elrond,\nalthough both of them knew that the wound would never fully heal, as it\nwas as spiritual as it was physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo\nawoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam,\nMerry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to\nbother him for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\nCouncil of Elrond\n\n\n\nAfter his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had\norganized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\ndiscussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One\nRing must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared,\nargument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission,\nuntil Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it\ninto the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples\noffered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn,\nGandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of\nthe Dwarves. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made\ncoat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had\nbeen given to Bilbo by Thorin after the events of _The Hobbit,_ and\nSting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On December 25,\nthe Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.\n\nMoria\n\n\n\nOn January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty\nMountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due\nto a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of\nMoria at the urging of Gimli. \n\nMoria (also named Khazad-dum), was the most ancient and grand of Dwarven\ncities, but was deserted when the dwarves uncovered a Balrog, known only\nas Durin's Bane, beneath the city, and had been defeated by legions of\ngoblins. When they entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship was\nattacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll\nbefore he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril shirt saving him\nfrom a deadly blow. The Fellowship ran through Moria to the Bridge of\nKhazad-dum, where Gandalf fell while confronting Durin's Bane. Once\noutside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and\nSam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.\n\nLothlórien\n\n\n\nDeeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven\nkingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord\nCeleborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror.\nFrodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take\nit, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the\ndiminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed\nfrom Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a\nphial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift\nwould prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also\nprovided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and ships for their\nvoyage down the Anduin River.\n\nThe Breaking of the Fellowship\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship continued their journey south to Amon Hen. There,\nBoromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to\nconvince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there.\nWhen the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir\nfollowed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested\ncourse of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.\n\nFrodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he\nwatched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the Eye of Sauron\nsearching for him as he traveled.\n\n\n\nTaking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone,\nwithout telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was\njoined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he\nshould protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and\nalthough reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have\nSam's company.\n\nThe two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Here\nBoromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the\ntwo young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken\nto Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three\nHunters decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their\ncaptors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.\n\nEmyn Muil\n\nAfter leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam\ntried to navigate through the winding paths of the Emyn Muil. After\ngetting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first\ntried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help)\nand tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature,\ndecided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude\nto the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and\ninto the Dead Marshes.\n\nThe Dead Marshes\n\n\n\nThe Dead Marshes followed the razor-sharp rocks of Emyn Muil, and were\njust as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route\nthrough the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum\nhad secretly discovered a path when out on one of his many errands. He\nled Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them\nnot to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.\n\nIthilien\n\nGollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had\ndesired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger\nwas too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the\nstairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves\nbeing led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a\nskirmish between a company of warriors from Haradrim (along with\nOliphaunts) and rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the\nranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir\nblindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth\nAnnûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Samwise\nfoolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One\nRing. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality,\nunlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free. Later,\nGollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the\nhidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed,\nalthough the rift between master and servant had once again begun to\nopen.\n\nMinas Morgul and Shelob's Lair\n\n\n\nGollum led the Hobbits past the lair of the Witch-King of Angmar, Minas\nMorgul, and up the stairs into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the\ntop though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously travelled\nthrough the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way\nbarred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the\nwebbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further\ninto the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the\nthreads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself\nsafe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak\nout and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's\nwebbing, Samwise was able to draw her into single combat wherein he,\nusing Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her\nand drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's\nneck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He\noverheard the orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master\nwas not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the tower of\nCirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.\n\nCirith Ungol\n\nFrodo was taken to the utmost top of Cirith Ungol and imprisoned.  He\nwas stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried.\nSquabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two\nlead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the orcs and Uruk-hai\nin the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his\nway blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, journeyed\nto the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the\ntower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying\nthem), and entered Mordor.\n\nMordor and Mount Doom\n\nFrodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the\nOrcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army,\nand, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb\nMount Doom. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or\nwater, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over\nhim grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable\nto go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his\nmaster rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum decided to\nreappear, and after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach, and\nFrodo fled up the mountain.\n\n \n\nInside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the\nring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at\nits strongest, due to the proximity of the cracks. It was here that\nFrodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam\nyelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its\npower and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell\nand hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When\nhe came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put\non the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was\nreunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he\ntoppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it\nlooked as though they were doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them,\nand with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and\nFrodo and flew them to safety.\n\nThe End of the War and the Departure of Frodo\n\nThe Scouring of the Shire\n\n\n\nAfter recovering in Minas Tirith, and witnessing the coronation of King\nAragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When\nthey arrived though, they found it under the control of a man named\nSharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was\nruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Grima\nWormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all\nthe Shirriffs and townsfolk in the Shire, and they successfully defeated\nthe Ruffians employed by Sharkey at the Battle of Bywater.\n\n\n\nFrodo wasn't directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater;\ninstead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit\nhad ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not\ngoing to begin there), and also that any ruffians that surrendered were\nnot harmed.\n\nThe Fourth Age\n\n\n\nFrodo briefly served as Deputy Mayor of the Shire, but soon realized\nthat he still bore the wounds of his quest, and so retired. He was also\nin continual pain from his shoulder wound, which pained him each\nanniversary of their stay on Weathertop. On 22 September SR 1421 (Fourth\nAge), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel,\nand Círdan aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea\nto the Undying Lands, as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing\nthe damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused. Sometime\nafter the year 61 in the Fourth Age, fellow ring-bearer and best friend\nSamwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the undying lands where it was\npresumed they lived out the remainder of their days.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nFrodo, as described by Gandalf, was “taller than some and fairer than\nmost, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.” (_The\nFellowship of the Ring_, Chapter 10, “Strider”)'' ''He was a shy, young\nhobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had\nlighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his\nBrandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a\nhobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is\nfifty, due to the influence of the Ring. Bilbo and Frodo shared a common\nbirthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the\nopening of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Frodo and Bilbo were\ncelebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays,\nrespectively. Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in\nHobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world,\nfascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo\ntravelled in _The Hobbit_) did not fit the general content personality\nof most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took\nancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and\nallowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of\nthe creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the\nquest's success in destroying the Ring. The influence of the Ring and\nthe wound by the Morgul-Blade seems combined to have given him the\nability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway\nevents in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of\npower worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger.\n\n\nWeapons and Attire\n\nFrodo was dressed in typical Hobbit-fashion when he left the Shire: knee\nbreeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright\ngreen and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a\npocketknife.\n\nWhen his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his\nsummer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by\nTom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on\nheavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found\nseveral long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as\nshort-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted\nthe Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit\nclothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly.\nTherefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers\ntogether with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and\nthen towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the\nwarmer weather. Later, his Uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic\nElven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life\ntwice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and\nsecond when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill\nhim.\n\nAs with the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo received\na special cloak from Galadriel in Lórien, which allowed him to blend in\nwith natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Gollum and captured by\nOrcs at Cirith Ungol, Frodo lost all of his clothing and most of his\npossessions. Sam Gamgee saved Sting, however. After the two tribes of\norcs had slain each other in the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo dressed\nhimself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Mordor-Orcs they\nencountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Sam\napproached Mount Doom.\n\nCombat\n\nSword\n\nFrodo used Bilbo's famed short sword Sting for melee combat, it was also\nput to great use as it warns him of nearby orcs and goblins by glowing\nblue.",

    "text": "FRODO BAGGINS, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during\nthe Third Age. He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character\nfor his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One\nRing to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best\nfriend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who\nsailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third\nAge.\n\n\nBiography\n\nChildhood\n\nMuch of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the\nancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula\nBrandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending\nMeriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing\ntrouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer\nMaggot's farm Bamfurlong.  \n\nIn TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a\nboating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in\nBrandy Hall until his 99-year-old “uncle” Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989.\nBilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him\nhis heir.\n\n\n\nThe two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of\nthe Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the\nlore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by\nShire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party\nof special magnificence was held at the beginning of The Fellowship of\nthe Ring when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the\npeculiar year of 111.\n\nBilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his\nfellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf\nquickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where\nBilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and\ndisgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.\n\nBefore departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long\nconversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily\nsurrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a\nnote for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.\n\nComing of Age and Quest Beginning\n\n\n\nAfter the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was\nnow the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring.\nGandalf, ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose\n(but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit\nagainst the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied\nwith the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on\nApril 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the\nRing was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord Sauron needed to\nrule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the\nRing, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to\nRivendell.\n\nAfter Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was\nrunning out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was\nencouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at\nCrickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had\nagreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of\nthe Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the\nSackville-Baggins, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his\nfiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and\nPippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as\nSauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire\ndressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.\n\nTo Bree\n\nFrodo was unable to find much information about his pursuers from his\nconversations with the High Elves and Farmer Maggot, but what they were\ntold was less than encouraging. When Frodo arrived at Buckland, where\nMerry was waiting, he found that Merry and Pippin already knew about\nFrodo's “secret” journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to\nbring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and\nthe Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed.\nThey met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man\nWillow and the Barrow-Wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a\nmysterious being who dwelled in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.\n\nStrider\n\n\n\nIn Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went\nby the name of Mr. Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as\npossible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the\nshadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper,\nBarliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man,\na Ranger, as Strider.\n\nThat night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search\nof Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits\nfrom them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself\nas Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the\nbackstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a\npony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo\nand his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to\nRivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to\nthe top of Weathertop.\n\nWeathertop\n\n\n\nOn the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of\nthe nine Ringwraiths at the hill of Weathertop. In the presence of the\nNazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to\nresist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the\nname of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader\nof the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder\n(he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-blade. If it had caught\nhim in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker\nand under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the\nappearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had\ntorches, one of their few weaknesses.\n\nThough Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A\nfragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it\ncontinued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was\nrescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his\nhorse, named Asfaloth. They were pursued by the Nazgûl as Asfaloth\ncarried Frodo to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of\nRivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, Frodo turned and saw\nthe Nine Ringwraiths on the other side. They ordered him to give up the\nRing, but Frodo refused.\n\n\n\nSubsequently, the Ringwraiths were washed away in a flood called up by\nElrond, the leader of Rivendell. He was healed in Rivendell by Elrond,\nalthough both of them knew that the wound would never fully heal, as it\nwas as spiritual as it was physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo\nawoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam,\nMerry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to\nbother him for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\nCouncil of Elrond\n\n\n\nAfter his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had\norganized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\ndiscussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One\nRing must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared,\nargument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission,\nuntil Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it\ninto the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples\noffered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn,\nGandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of\nthe Dwarves. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made\ncoat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had\nbeen given to Bilbo by Thorin after the events of _The Hobbit,_ and\nSting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On December 25,\nthe Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.\n\nMoria\n\n\n\nOn January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty\nMountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due\nto a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of\nMoria at the urging of Gimli. \n\nMoria (also named Khazad-dum), was the most ancient and grand of Dwarven\ncities, but was deserted when the dwarves uncovered a Balrog, known only\nas Durin's Bane, beneath the city, and had been defeated by legions of\ngoblins. When they entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship was\nattacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll\nbefore he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril shirt saving him\nfrom a deadly blow. The Fellowship ran through Moria to the Bridge of\nKhazad-dum, where Gandalf fell while confronting Durin's Bane. Once\noutside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and\nSam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.\n\nLothlórien\n\n\n\nDeeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven\nkingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord\nCeleborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror.\nFrodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take\nit, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the\ndiminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed\nfrom Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a\nphial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift\nwould prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also\nprovided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and ships for their\nvoyage down the Anduin River.\n\nThe Breaking of the Fellowship\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship continued their journey south to Amon Hen. There,\nBoromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to\nconvince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there.\nWhen the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir\nfollowed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested\ncourse of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.\n\nFrodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he\nwatched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the Eye of Sauron\nsearching for him as he traveled.\n\n\n\nTaking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone,\nwithout telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was\njoined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he\nshould protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and\nalthough reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have\nSam's company.\n\nThe two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Here\nBoromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the\ntwo young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken\nto Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three\nHunters decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their\ncaptors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.\n\nEmyn Muil\n\nAfter leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam\ntried to navigate through the winding paths of the Emyn Muil. After\ngetting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first\ntried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help)\nand tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature,\ndecided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude\nto the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and\ninto the Dead Marshes.\n\nThe Dead Marshes\n\n\n\nThe Dead Marshes followed the razor-sharp rocks of Emyn Muil, and were\njust as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route\nthrough the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum\nhad secretly discovered a path when out on one of his many errands. He\nled Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them\nnot to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.\n\nIthilien\n\nGollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had\ndesired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger\nwas too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the\nstairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves\nbeing led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a\nskirmish between a company of warriors from Haradrim (along with\nOliphaunts) and rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the\nranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir\nblindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth\nAnnûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Samwise\nfoolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One\nRing. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality,\nunlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free. Later,\nGollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the\nhidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed,\nalthough the rift between master and servant had once again begun to\nopen.\n\nMinas Morgul and Shelob's Lair\n\n\n\nGollum led the Hobbits past the lair of the Witch-King of Angmar, Minas\nMorgul, and up the stairs into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the\ntop though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously travelled\nthrough the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way\nbarred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the\nwebbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further\ninto the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the\nthreads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself\nsafe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak\nout and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's\nwebbing, Samwise was able to draw her into single combat wherein he,\nusing Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her\nand drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's\nneck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He\noverheard the orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master\nwas not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the tower of\nCirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.\n\nCirith Ungol\n\nFrodo was taken to the utmost top of Cirith Ungol and imprisoned.  He\nwas stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried.\nSquabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two\nlead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the orcs and Uruk-hai\nin the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his\nway blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, journeyed\nto the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the\ntower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying\nthem), and entered Mordor.\n\nMordor and Mount Doom\n\nFrodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the\nOrcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army,\nand, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb\nMount Doom. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or\nwater, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over\nhim grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable\nto go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his\nmaster rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum decided to\nreappear, and after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach, and\nFrodo fled up the mountain.\n\n \n\nInside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the\nring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at\nits strongest, due to the proximity of the cracks. It was here that\nFrodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam\nyelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its\npower and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell\nand hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When\nhe came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put\non the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was\nreunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he\ntoppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it\nlooked as though they were doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them,\nand with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and\nFrodo and flew them to safety.\n\nThe End of the War and the Departure of Frodo\n\nThe Scouring of the Shire\n\n\n\nAfter recovering in Minas Tirith, and witnessing the coronation of King\nAragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When\nthey arrived though, they found it under the control of a man named\nSharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was\nruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Grima\nWormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all\nthe Shirriffs and townsfolk in the Shire, and they successfully defeated\nthe Ruffians employed by Sharkey at the Battle of Bywater.\n\n\n\nFrodo wasn't directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater;\ninstead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit\nhad ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not\ngoing to begin there), and also that any ruffians that surrendered were\nnot harmed.\n\nThe Fourth Age\n\n\n\nFrodo briefly served as Deputy Mayor of the Shire, but soon realized\nthat he still bore the wounds of his quest, and so retired. He was also\nin continual pain from his shoulder wound, which pained him each\nanniversary of their stay on Weathertop. On 22 September SR 1421 (Fourth\nAge), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel,\nand Círdan aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea\nto the Undying Lands, as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing\nthe damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused. Sometime\nafter the year 61 in the Fourth Age, fellow ring-bearer and best friend\nSamwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the undying lands where it was\npresumed they lived out the remainder of their days.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nFrodo, as described by Gandalf, was “taller than some and fairer than\nmost, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.” (_The\nFellowship of the Ring_, Chapter 10, “Strider”)'' ''He was a shy, young\nhobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had\nlighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his\nBrandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a\nhobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is\nfifty, due to the influence of the Ring. Bilbo and Frodo shared a common\nbirthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the\nopening of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Frodo and Bilbo were\ncelebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays,\nrespectively. Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in\nHobbiton to be a little odd.

Colors such as bright\ngreen and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a\npocketknife.\n\nWhen his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his\nsummer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by\nTom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on\nheavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found\nseveral long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as\nshort-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted\nthe Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit\nclothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly.\nTherefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers\ntogether with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and\nthen towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the\nwarmer weather. Later, his Uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic\nElven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life\ntwice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and\nsecond when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill\nhim.\n\nAs with the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo received\na special cloak from Galadriel in Lórien, which allowed him to blend in\nwith natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Gollum and captured by\nOrcs at Cirith Ungol, Frodo lost all of his clothing and most of his\npossessions. Sam Gamgee saved Sting, however. After the two tribes of\norcs had slain each other in the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo dressed\nhimself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Mordor-Orcs they\nencountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Sam\napproached Mount Doom.\n\nCombat\n\nSword\n\nFrodo used Bilbo's famed short sword Sting for melee combat, it was also\nput to great use as it warns him of nearby orcs and goblins by glowing\nblue.\n\n\nAppearances\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n\nIn the movies\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n\nWritings\n\n-   The Return and Departures of Frodo and Sam\n-   The Days of Rohan\n-   The Battles of Shilverman and Bywater\n\n\nHistory and Conception\n\nConception\n\nOriginally, Frodo was to be named Bingo Bolger-Baggins, but as the work\nbecame more serious, that name was dropped.",

    "text": "ARAGORN II, the son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as ELESSAR\nand STRIDER, was the 16TH CHIEFTAIN OF THE DÚNEDAIN OF THE NORTH; later\ncrowned KING ELESSAR TELCONTAR (March 1, 2931 - FO 120 or SR 1541), the\n26th King of Arnor and 35th King of Gondor - and first High King of\nGondor and Arnor since the short reign of Isildur. He was a great ranger\nand warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil,\nreforged and renamed _Andúril_, in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\n\n\nAragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His ancestor Arvedui was\nwedded to Fíriel, who was descended from Anárion, who bore their son\nAranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of Anárion as well.\n\nWhen he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while\npursuing orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond.\nAt the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared\nhe would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity\nas the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn\nwas renamed _ESTEL_ and was not told about his heritage until 2951.\n\n\n\nElrond revealed to “Estel” his true name and ancestry when he was\ntwenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil.\nElrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he “came of\nthe right” to possess the item. It was also around this time that\nAragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly\nreturned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her\ngrandmother Galadriel.\n\nAragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of\nthe Dúnedain and the Rangers of the North, and left the comforts of\nRivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people,\nwhose kingdom had been destroyed through civil and regional wars\ncenturies before.\n\nAragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends.\nHeeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small\nland known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian\nHobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's\nborders as STRIDER.\n\nFrom TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in\nthe armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor.\nMany of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the\ngrowing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless\nexperience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring.\nAragorn served his lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan\nduring that time was THORONGIL (“Eagle of the Star”). With a small\nGondor squadron of ships, he led an assault on the long-standing rebel\nprovince of Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and\npersonally slaying their lord during the battle on the Havens. After the\nvictory at Umbar, “Thorongil” left the field and, to the dismay of his\nmen, went east.\n\n\n\nLater in 2980, he visited Lórien, and there once again met Arwen. He\ngave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the\nhill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage,\nrenouncing her elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Men: death.\n\nElrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such\na time as his foster son should be king of _both_ Gondor and Arnor. As\nboth Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required\nto choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his\ndaughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's\nown happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and\nthat of her beloved) too difficult to bear.\n\nBefore the events of _The Lord of the Rings_ properly take place,\nAragorn also traveled through the Dwarven mines of Moria, to Harad,\nwhere (in his own words) “the stars are strange.” Tolkien does not\nspecify when these travels occurred nor does he indicate what happens\nwhen Aragorn visits.\n\nIn 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the ring belonging to\nthe Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the\nsource of the Dark Lord Sauron's evil power. Aragorn went at his request\ninto Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He\ncaught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as\na captive to Thranduil's halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned\nhim.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nAragorn joined Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's adopted heir, and three of his\nfriends at the Inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree. Though originally\nthe hobbits were suspicious of Strider, they eventually trusted him and\nprepared to escape Bree and the Ringwraiths. These four had set out\nfrom the Shire to bring the One Ring to Rivendell. Aragorn was aged 87\nat that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean\ndescent. With Aragorn's help, the Hobbits escaped the pursuing\nNazgûl. The elf-lord Glorfindel later arrived and led them to\nRivendell.\n\nThere, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing that was formed to guard Frodo, tasked with destroying the Ring in\nthe fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo,\nthe company included  Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee,\nLegolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.\n\n All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by\nthe frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the\nshadows shall spring; Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken, The\ncrownless again shall be king.\n\n    — Bilbo's poem about Aragorn\n\nBefore the group set out, the shards of Narsil were reforged, and the\nrestored blade was named Andúril.\n\nAragorn accompanied the group through an attempt to cross the pass of\nCaradhras and through the mines of Moria. He helped protect Frodo from\nan Orc captain and became group leader after Gandalf was presumed lost\nin battle with a Balrog. Aragorn led the company to Lórien, where\nLady Galadriel gave him the Elessar.\n\nAfter Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the river Anduin to\nthe Falls of Rauros. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor\nand aid its people in the War, he felt responsible for Frodo after the\nloss of Gandalf.\n\n\n\nAfter passing into the Argonath, the Fellowship camped in Amon Hen.\nFrodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One\nRing trying to take it. Frodo put the ring on, rendering him invisible,\nand ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen;\nfrom there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt\nthe eye but it was distracted by Gandalf the White later found in\nFangorn Forest by (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli looking for Merry and\nPippin.) Frodo would struggle against the power of Sauron, finally\ntaking the ring off. Then Frodo knew what had to be done: He was to go\nalone to Mordor to destroy the ring. On the way back to the river he\nmeets Sam, who goes with him.\n\n\n\nAt this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's Uruk-hai and a\nbattle ensued. During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending\nMerry and Pippin and giving up his desire for the ring in a last attempt\nto resist the ring. After discovering that Frodo had left, Aragorn and\nthe others decided that they would leave Frodo and Sam to continue their\nquest on their own. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn put Boromir's body and\nwar gear in one of the elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to\nBoromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent to the Falls\nof Rauros.\n\nWhile Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas\nand Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured\nby the Uruk-hai working for Saruman.\n\nThe Three Hunters\n\n\n\nIn the fields of Rohan, the Three Hunters Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli\nencountered Éomer, who had recently been pursuing rumours of an orc raid\nin the area. From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped\nMerry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been\nfound. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle.\nClues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and\nhe led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest. They did not find the\nHobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back from Valinor to\ncontinue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters\nthat the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.\n\n Where now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar? Where do thy kinsfolk\nwander afar? Near is the hour when the lost should come forth, And the\nGrey Company ride from the North. But dark is the path appointed to\nthee: The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.\n\n    - Galadriel's message to Aragorn\n\nTogether, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where\nGandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize\nthe Rohirrim against Saruman. He allied with Théoden and led the\nrefugees to Helm's Deep.\n\n\n\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli then help the people of Rohan in the Battle\nof the Hornburg, in which they conclusively and victoriously defeated\nSaruman's army.Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to Isengard only\nto find Isengard in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being\npresent with Gandalf, Theoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiate in a\nfinal parley with Saruman. Saruman at first tries to bend Theoden to his\nwill and at first Theoden is almost swayed but then he masters his will\nand refuses to join with Saruman. Saruman then sneers at Theoden and\nturns his attention to Gandalf and tries to sway him, only to be laughed\nat. Then Gandalf offers him a chance of repentance without limits.\nSaruman turns white in his face at this, sadly in the end however\nSaruman refuses to repent out of pride and to leave Orthanc. Gandalf\nbreaks Saruman's staff as he is no longer the head and is banished from\nthe Order of Wizards and The White Council. After Saruman crawls away,\nGrima Wormtongue then throws the Palantír of Orthanc at Gandalf as he\nand the others are leaving the Orthanc tower. But misses not being able\nto decide who he hated more Gandalf or Saruman. Thus ending the Battle\nof the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.\n\nReturn of the King\n\n\n\nIn order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead,\nand summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the King\nof Gondor. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that\nthe Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying\nGondor a millennia before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were\ndefeated.\n\nAragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and\nsoldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas\nTirith. When they arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Aragorn\nunfurled a standard that Arwen had made for him which showed both the\nWhite Tree of Gondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the\nHouse of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of\nGondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.\n\nThe Steward Denethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant\nof Isildur (years before, he had seen “Thorongil” as a rival to his\nfather's favor). Aragorn healed Faramir, Denethor's last heir, winning\nhim the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne;\nhis humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants\nof Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a\nsign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as\nIoreth said, _“The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so\nshall the rightful king be known.”_ The people hailed him as King that\nsame evening.\n\nDespite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his\nclaim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to\nlay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively\npromoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were\nnot out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for\nGondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So,\nto avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following\nnights of March 15–16, he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to\nenter it again until he was crowned King on May first.\n\nAs Reunited King of Gondor and Arnor\n\n\n\nUpon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as KING ELESSAR, a name given\nto him by Galadriel. He became the TWENTY-SIXTH KING OF ARNOR,\nTHIRTY-FIFTH KING OF GONDOR and the first HIGH KING OF THE REUNITED\nKINGDOM, though it would be several years before his authority was\nfirmly reestablished in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of\nTelcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for “Strider”). Aragorn married Arwen\nshortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120\nof the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity\nwithin Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and\ncommunication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous\nrebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the\nReunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and\nHaradrim, re-establishing rule over much territory that Gondor had lost\nin previous centuries.\nDuring his coronation, Aragorn sang Elendil's Oath: _“Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!”_\n(“Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place I will\nabide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.”)\n\nDeath and End of Reign\n\n\n\nWhen in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days\nwere at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street.\nHe said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion\nhis crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died.\nShortly a year after Aragorn died, Arwen soon died of a broken heart.\nEldarion began his reign as the Second King of the Reunited Kingdom\nafter his father's and mother's death.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nTolkien gives a brief but detailed description of him in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_: lean, dark, tall, with “a shaggy head of dark hair flecked\nwith grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.”\n\nIn _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_, he was said to be often grim and\nsad, with unexpected moments of levity. Some time after the\npublications of the books, Tolkien wrote that he was six feet six inches\ntall.\n\nAragorn possessed Elven wisdom due to his childhood in Rivendell with\nElrond and the foresight of the Dúnedain. He was also a skilled healer,\nnotably with the plant _Athelas_ (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also\na mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, he, Éomer, and Imrahil were said to be left unscathed,\neven though they had been in the thick of the fighting.\n\nThough there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny\nas the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the\nwar against Sauron (as he did in Peter Jackson's film), he was not\nimmune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while\nleading the Fellowship after the loss of Gandalf in Moria, and blamed\nhimself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.\n\nOn one occasion, his pride (or reverence for his heritage) led to\ncomplications, as he refused to disarm and leave his sword Andúril (a\npriceless heirloom of Númenor and one of the weapons which slew Sauron)\nat the door of Edoras, as Théoden had required, and only did so after\nGandalf left his own sword (also of high lineage) behind. Even so, he\nswore that death would come to anyone else who touched it (whether by\nhis own hand or by some magic, it is left unsaid).\n\nHe also appeared to possess a nigh-indomidable will. At one point, he\nwas able to psychically challenge Sauron for control of the Palantir of\nOrthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that\neven Gandalf the White was reluctant to use the Palantir for fear of\nchallenging Sauron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. He\nwas accounted as “the hardiest of living Men” during his lifetime.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _ARAGORN_ means “Revered King”, from the Sindarin _ara_\n(“king”) and _(n)gorn_ (“revered”).. Aragorn was named after Aragorn\nI.\n\nOther names\n\n-   ELESSAR - Aragorn's name as king (Quenya)\n-   EDHELHARN - Sindarin translation of Elessar\n-   ELFSTONE - Westron translation of Elessar\n-   ESTEL - Aragorn's nickname during his childhood in Rivendell. It\n    means “Hope”\n-   LONGSHANKS - Used by Samwise Gamgee and some of the Men of Bree\n-   STICK-AT-NAUGHT STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree, particularly Bill\n    Ferny \n-   STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree\n-   TELCONTAR - Quenya translation of Strider and the name of his House\n-   THORONGIL - Aragorn's alias during his travels to Rohan and Gondor.\n    It means “Eagle of the Star”\n-   WINGFOOT - Given by Éomer\n\nTitles\n\nAs king, Aragorn had many titles:\n\n-   THE DÚNADAN\n-   CHIEFTAIN OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   HEIR OF ISILDUR\n-   KING OF ALL THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   KING OF THE WEST\n-   LORD OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   ENVINYATAR - “the Renewer”\n-   KING OF GONDOR\n-   KING OF ARNOR\n-   HIGH KING OF GONDOR AND ARNOR\n-   LORD OF THE HOUSE OF TELCONTAR\n\n\nWeapons\n\n\n\nAs a Ranger, Aragorn was trained to be proficient with various weapons,\nsuch as bows, knives, spears and swords In battle he focused primarily\non his sword play, preferring close combat to a long scale fight. He was\na mighty warrior, and as such easily defeated many types of foes,\nranging from large groups of orcs to far more powerful foes such as\nTrolls and Ringwraiths, evident throughout various battles like Helm's\nDeep and the Morannon. In each case, Aragorn's finesse in battle has\nserved him greatly and earned him much recognition and respect from both\nthe Fellowship of the Ring and the people of Rohan and Gondor. He was\narguably the greatest swordsman of the Third Age, surpassing the likes\nof Faramir, Boromir and perhaps even Elrond.\n\nAragorn's sword is Andúril, Flame of the West, the reforged sword\nNarsil, Elendil's blade that Isildur used to cut the One Ring from\nSauron's hand. Aragorn uses it with the same skill the Numenoreans had\nlong ago.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe restoration of the line of Elendil to the throne of Gondor is a\nsubplot of _The Lord of the Rings_; Aragorn's adventures not only aid\nFrodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which,\nthough his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to\nhistorical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of Gondor have\nbeen under the rule of the Stewards of Gondor for centuries, as it was\nwidely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. Shortly after\nIsildur's departure, Meneldil, son of Anárion, had severed Gondor from\nArnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with\nthe northern line (as Isildur was Elendil's eldest son). This\narrangement had been reinforced by the Steward Pelendur in nearly 2,000\nyears before when he rejected Arvedui's claim to the Throne of Gondor\nduring a Gondorian succession crisis (Eärnil, a member of the House of\nAnárion, was eventually chosen as King instead). It is worth noting,\nhowever, that Arvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had\nmarried a descendant of Anárion: thus, Aragorn was technically a\ndescendant of not only Elendil and Isildur but of Anárion as well.\n\n\nConcept and creation\n\nIdentity\n\nThe “first term” of the character that later evolved into Aragorn or\nStrider was a peculiar hobbit met by Bingo Bolger-Baggins (precursor of\nFrodo Baggins) at the inn of The Prancing Pony. His description and\nbehavior, however, was already quite close to the final story, with the\ndifference that the hobbit wore wooden shoes, and was nicknamed Trotter\nfor the “clitter-clap” sound that they produced. He was also accounted\nto be “one of the wild folk — rangers”, and he played the same role in\nFrodo's journey to Rivendell as in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nLater Tolkien hesitated about the true identity of “Trotter” for a long\ntime. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits\nas originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either\na Man, or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was “very\nwell known” (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an\nearly comment of Bingo: “I keep on feeling that I have seen him\nsomewhere before”. Tolkien made a proposal that Trotter might be Bilbo\nBaggins himself, but rejected that idea.\n\nAnother suggestion was that Trotter was “Fosco Took (Bilbo's first\ncousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to Gandalf”. This story was\nfurther elaborated, making Trotter a nephew of Bilbo, named Peregrin\nBoffin, and an elder cousin of Frodo. He was said to have run away after\nhe came of age, some twenty years before Bilbo's party, and had helped\nGandalf in tracking Gollum later. A hint was also given as to why\nTrotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in\nMordor and tortured, but saved by Gandalf; a note was added by Tolkien\nin the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that Trotter had\nwooden feet.\n\nThe conception of Trotter being a hobbit was discarded with the\nfollowing recommencing of writing; another short-lived idea was to make\nTrotter “a disguised elf − friend of Bilbo's in Rivendell”, and a scout\nfrom Rivendell who “pretends to be a ranger”.\n\nQuite soon Tolkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter,\nfrom the beginning introducing him as a “descendant of the ancient men\nof the North, and one of Elrond's household”, as well as the name\nAragorn. While the history of Númenor and the descendants of Elros and\nElendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and\nwould come to be connected with The Lord of the Rings as the character\nof Aragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second\nand Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association\nwith them.\n\nFurther character developments\n\nThe development of Aragorn's connection to Gondor was long and complex,\nas was his association with Boromir. Initially it is said that Aragorn's\nforefathers were the exiles of Númenor who ruled over the people of Ond\n(early name of Gondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King “when\nSauron raised a rebellion”. The story of the two branches of Elendil's\ndescendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations\nonly emerged gradually; at one time, Tolkien even seems to have\nconceived only three generations between Isildur and Aragorn.\n\nOne significant feature which was not established until late stages was\nAragorn's relationship with Arwen. When Tolkien first introduced Éowyn,\nthe interest which she showed towards Aragorn was not one-sided, with\nsuggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story.\nAnother proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge\nThéoden, and Aragorn would never marry after her death.\n\nThe first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undomiel, was in\nreference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not\ngive any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references\nto her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly\nstated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working\non the appendices for The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien recorded the\nfull tale of Aragorn and Arwen.\n\nA passing idea was that Galadriel gave her Ring to Aragorn, and that he\nwould accordingly be titled the “Lord of the Ring”.\n\nRejected names\n\nThe original nickname TROTTER was retained for a long while, and Tolkien\ndecided to change it to Strider only after the story was completed.\nThere were also several experimental translations of Trotter to\nSindarin: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly\nbeing equivalent to Peregrin (Boffin). Instead of the latter title “the\nDúnadan”, Quenya Tarkil (“Noble Man”) was first used, synonym with\nNúmenórean.\n\nTolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's “real” name. Although\nAragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled,\nit was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an\nElvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via\nElfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing-\nrepresenting “west”. Later, however, a new plot element was introduced:\nGaladriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to\nElfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained\ninto the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a\ntranslation of Elessar.\n\nAmong other names to be used instead of Elfstone Tolkien considered\nElfstan, Elfmere, Elf-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erkenbrand, with\nvarious Elvish forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name\nof Aragorn's father also passed through many transient forms: Tolkien\nintended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aragorn before settling\nupon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim\nwith Ingold.\n\n\nHistory and Mythology\n\nRichard J. Finn presented a paper entitled “Arthur and Aragorn -\nArthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on\nMedieval Studies”. The are additional similarities between Aragorn and\nArthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings\nof Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aragorn becomes King of Gondor. Kings of the\nperiod in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh,\nstill known as _Dùn Éideann_ in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to\nDúnadan. For “Men of the North”, Goddodin was a far northern kingdom.\nArthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long gray robe for\nwhich he was called “His Grey Eminence” - Gandalf the White also wore a\ngray robe at Aragorn's coronation to indicate he at one time was Gandalf\nthe Grey.",

    "text": "GANDALF (Norse; IPA: - “Elf of the Wand” or “Wand-elf”)_' the Grey_',\nlater known as GANDALF THE WHITE, and originally named OLÓRIN (Quenya;\nIPA: - “Dreamer” or “Of Dreams”), was an _Istar_ (wizard), sent by the\nWest in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin\nand his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the\nFellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples\nin the final campaign of the War of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n\n\nOriginally called OLÓRIN, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar\n(with the possible exception of Melian). He was a Maia of Manwë and\nVarda. He also served under two other Valar, such as Irmo and Nienna.\nWhen the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as\nWizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those in\nMiddle-earth who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda decided\nto include Olórin among the five who were sent.\n\nAt first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and too\nafraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told him that that was one main\nreason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Thus, he insisted that\nOlórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him not to include\nOlórin as the third, but as the second. Olórin agreed, and prepared\nfor his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four wizards.\n\nThird Age\n\nArrival in Middle-earth\n\nWhen he arrived to Middle-earth, he received Narya, the ring of fire,\nfrom Círdan the Shipwright. Olórin, renamed _GANDALF_, spent many\ncenturies walking among the Elves as a stranger, learning from them and\nteaching them. He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and\neventually became known as the wisest of and most powerful of that\norder. He joined the White Council, which was formed to investigate a\ndark power in Dol Guldur, of which Galadriel wanted him to become the\nleader, yet Saruman came to lead the Council instead of him. Although\nSaruman was initially more powerful, was more knowledgeable about many\nmatters regarding Sauron and the Rings of Power, and was head of the\nWhite Council before the War of the Ring, he later grew jealous and\nafraid of Gandalf, which was the reason of his betrayal.\n\nQuest to Erebor\n\n\n\nGandalf wandered for many years amongst the Free People of Middle-earth,\nbut spent most of that time amongst the Elves, where he learned much and\ntaught much. He also continued to gather such information about Sauron\nand his ilk as he could, and to that end, he began to suspect that the\nNecromancer of Dol Guldur was in fact Sauron taking shape once again. He\nentered Dol Guldur, but Sauron, still greatly weakened, fled from him\nand for a short time, the evil of Mirkwood was greatly reduced. However,\nSauron quickly returned to Dol Guldur, and by 2850 of the Third Age, had\nrebuilt his forces there. In that year, Gandalf again entered the\nfortress and encountered Thráin II, father of Thorin Oakenshield, who\nwas dying after having been horribly tormented. Before his death, the\nold Dwarf king entrusted Gandalf with a map and key to the Lonely\nMountain.\n\nIn the year 2941, Gandalf became troubled by his knowledge of Sauron's\nresurgent strength. He knew that Sauron was already plotting war from\nDol Guldur, and that as soon as he felt strong enough, he would attack\nRivendell. Unfortunately, the only power left besides Rivendell to\nresist an attempt from Mirkwood to regain the lands of Angmar was the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills. Even worse, Gandalf knew that Smaug to Golden\nresided still in the Lonely Mountain, and that Sauron could and would\nuse the dragon to devastating effect once he became strong enough to\ninfluence Smaug. However, Saruman seemed reluctant to engage Sauron's\nforces, though none of the White Council realized that he was already a\ntraitor.\n\nOne night, while pondering the problem of the Free People's weakness in\nthe North, Gandalf had a chance encounter in Bree with the Dwarf Thorin\nII Oakenshield, who was also searching, without direction or much hope,\nfor a way to reclaim the Kingdom Under the Mountain. Gandalf and Thorin\nthen concocted a plan (more Gandalf's than Thorin's) to potentially draw\nthe dragon out of the mountain and reclaim the kingdom. To that end,\nGandalf visited Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire, to convince him to\ngo with Thorin and Company to Erebor and aid them. At the time, Bilbo\nthought of him as little more than a vain, a fussy old conjurer who\nentertained children with fireworks during festivals and parties, but\nsoon discovered his true nature. It is on this quest that Gandalf\nfinds his sword, Glamdring, and that Bilbo finds his sword, Sting,\nand the One Ring (though at the time it is mistaken for a lesser\nring).\n\nGandalf himself joined the quest both in order to see what he could do\nto destroy the dragon, and to try to convince the White Council\n(particularly Saruman) to oust Sauron from Dol Guldur. During the\nDwarves' quest, Gandalf vanished twice— once to scout their path, the\nsecond time to “attend to other pressing business”, the nature of\nwhich he refused to discuss. He was actually attending a meeting of the\nWhite Council. When Bilbo found the One Ring, Gandalf was immediately\nsuspicious of the Hobbit's story of how he acquired it. He privately\nconfronted Bilbo and forced the truth out of him, and is deeply troubled\nby his story of the Ring's powers as they seem eerily familiar. Perhaps\neven more troubling to him is that Bilbo, a proper, honorable hobbit,\nwould uncharacteristically lie about his story.\n\n Gandalf abandoned\nThorin's company when they reached Mirkwood to participate in the White\nCouncil's assault on Dol Guldur. The attack appeared to drive out The\nNecromancer (Sauron), though he immediately retreated to his\nlong-prepared stronghold of Barad-dûr. Gandalf rejoined Thorin's company\nat the very moment the Battle of Five Armies breaks out, bearing news of\nthe arrival of a goblin and warg army. Gandalf fought in the battle, and\nhelped destroy the goblin threat. Thorin himself was slain during the\nbattle, but Gandalf's primary aim was achieved; with the destruction of\nSmaug and the ousting of the goblin army, Dáin II Ironfoot became King\nunder the Mountain and restored the Lonely Mountain to a powerful\nkingdom. This, along with the strengthening of the Kingdom of Dale,\nallowed the Free People of the Northern region of Middle-earth to have\nconsiderable preparation against Sauron's forces during the later War of\nthe Ring, where before they had virtually none. Following the battle,\nGandalf accompanied Bilbo back to the Shire.\n\nBefore the War\n\nReturn to the Shire\n\nGandalf spent the years between TA 2941 to TA 3001 travelling\nMiddle-earth in search of information on Sauron's resurgence and Bilbo's\nmysterious ring. He spent as much time as he could in the Shire,\nhowever, strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and befriending Bilbo's\nnephew, Frodo, while simultaneously becoming suspicious of Saruman and\nhis allegiances.\n\n\n\nIn TA 3001, around the time of Bilbo's “Eleventy-First” (111th) birthday\nparty, Gandalf returned to the Shire, bringing along many fireworks for\nthe occasion. After seeing Frodo and visiting Bilbo again, Gandalf\nattended the party.\n\nDuring Bilbo's speech, he put on a mysterious ring and disappeared, as a\njoke on his neighbours. Later as he was bidding farewell to Gandalf, who\nhad known about his plans to leave, Bilbo began to change his mind about\nleaving his ring to Frodo, as he had earlier agreed. When Gandalf tried\nto persuade him to leave it, Bilbo became hostile and accused Gandalf of\ntrying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as\nhis “precious.” Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full\nheight and appeared menacing, frightening the hobbit. This brought Bilbo\nback to his senses; he apologised, admitted that the Ring had been\ntroubling him lately, and left the ring behind. Bilbo and Gandalf bid\neach other goodbye, before Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.\n\n\n\nGandalf, troubled by this, mulled over Bilbo's agressive behaviour.\nBefore finally leaving the Shire, Gandalf gave the ring to Frodo,\nadvising him to keep it safe. Over the next seventeen years, Gandalf\ntraveled extensively, searching for answers. Having long sought for\nGollum near Mordor, he met Aragorn, who had captured the creature in\nMirkwood.\n\nGandalf interrogated Gollum and learned that Sauron had forced Gollum to\ntell what he knew about the ring under torture. Gandalf left Mirkwood\nsoon after, and left Gollum with the Wood-elves of Northern Mirkwood.\n\nSaruman's betrayal\n\n\n\nUpon returning to the Shire, Gandalf immediately went to Frodo and\nconfirmed his suspicions by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth fire,\nwhich revealed, in Black Speech, the inscription upon the ring. Gandalf\nthen told a dumbfounded Frodo about the One Ring and its history, and\nhow Sauron would seek to regain it. Instructing Frodo to go to Rivendell\nwith the ring, Gandalf told him to make arrangements to leave the Shire\nquietly.\n\nRiding near the Shire, Gandalf encountered Radagast the Brown, another\nWizard, referred to as “his cousin”, who asked him to seek out\nSaruman the White, as the Nazgûl had come forth and crossed the River\nAnduin. Before he left, Gandalf instructed Radagast to alert all the\n'birds and beasts' that were friendly to the latter to convey messages\nabout the Nazgûl to Saruman and Gandalf at Orthanc.\n\n\n\nLeaving a note for Frodo with Barliman Butterbur, an inn-keeper in Bree,\nGandalf left for Isengard to speak with Saruman. Once there, however,\nGandalf discovered that Saruman wanted the One Ring to himself and\ndeclared himself Saruman of Many Colours. He tried to convince Gandalf\nto either join with him in service to Sauron, so that they could\neventually control the Dark Lord and thus achieve good ends, though\nthrough evil means, or to help him find the One Ring so they could take\npower from Sauron. Gandalf refused, and was held prisoner at the top of\nthe tower Orthanc.\n\nJourney to Rivendell\n\n\n\nAfter spending a while as Saruman's prisoner, Gandalf was eventually\nrescued by Gwaihir the Eagle. Gwaihir's real purpose for visiting\nOrthanc was to report a sighting of the Nazgûl, as Radagast had appealed\nto him to do so earlier on. The great Eagle set Gandalf down in Rohan,\nwhere he appealed to King Théoden for a horse.\n\nKing Théoden allowed Gandalf to take any horse he desired, but only to\ndo so quickly. There, Gandalf chose the horse Shadowfax. Riding for the\nShire, Gandalf arrived too late for Frodo; he had already set out.\n\nKnowing that Frodo would be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf began to make\nhis own way there. Shortly after arriving in Bree, Gandalf learned that\nthe Hobbits had already began travelling to Rivendell with his ally and\nold friend: Aragorn. Subsequently, Gandalf was confronted one night\nby Sauron's Nazgûl at Weathertop. After an all-night battle with the\nRingwraiths, Gandalf was able to eventually escape, though four of the\nnine Nazgûl pursued him.\n\nSeveral days later, Frodo, Aragorn, and company stayed at Weathertop and\nwere confronted by the remaining five Nazgûl. Despite their escape,\nFrodo was stabbed in the process by the Ringwraith leader, who used a\nMorgul-blade. Gandalf was able to evade the four Nazgûl and\nsuccessfully reach Rivendell. However, several days later, an injured\nFrodo arrived at the Ford of Bruinen, though the Nazgûl pursued him all\nthe way there. Gandalf, along with Elrond, saved Frodo from the Nazgûl\nby enchanting the water and sweeping them away.\n\nForming of the Fellowship\n\n At Rivendell, Gandalf, along with Frodo, Bilbo, and\nmany others, attended the secret Council of Elrond. There Gandalf\nexplained to the others how Saruman had imprisoned him and how the White\nWizard was creating his own army of orcs to rival Sauron's.\n\nAs everyone at the Council debated over the ring, Frodo offered to be\nthe ring-bearer and take it to Mount Doom to be destroyed. Gandalf\nvolunteered to help and protect Frodo on his quest, along with Aragorn,\nBoromir, Legolas, and Gimli. Sam snuck in and was allowed to go because\nof this.\n\n\n\nWith this the Fellowship of the Ring was formed. Gandalf later convinced\nElrond to allow Frodo's cousins, Merry and Pippin, to join the\nFellowship. Subsequently, after preparing for the journey, the\nFellowship left Rivendell. Gandalf took leadership of the Fellowship,\nleading the group south after leaving Rivendell. He and Aragorn led the\nhobbits and their companions on an unsuccessful effort to cross Mount\nCaradhras.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMines of Moria\n\nThey then took the “dark and secret way” through the Mines of Moria,\nmuch to Aragorn's discomfort; though he had passed through the Mines\nonce before, he had no desire to go through them again, and he feared\nfor Gandalf if they did so. As they tried to leave the mines, at the\nBridge of Khazad-dûm, Gandalf faced a Balrog, known commonly as Durin's\nBane. It was one of the Maiar corrupted by Melkor in the early days\nof Arda.\n\n Gandalf stopped on the Bridge,\nstanding in the middle of the span, allowing the others to escape. He\nleaned on the staff in his left hand and held the sword Glamdring,\ngleaming cold and white, in his right. The Balrog stepped onto the\nBridge, facing Gandalf, and the shadow about it reached out like two\nvast wings. It raised its whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire\ncame from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm and declared that the\nBalrog could not pass. They clashed, and the Balrog's sword was\nshattered. Then the Balrog leaped full upon the Bridge, and Gandalf\nlifted his staff and smote the span. His staff broke, but the Bridge\ncracked at the Balrog's feet. The stone beneath the Balrog broke and\nfell, taking the Balrog with it into the abyss, but the thongs of its\nwhip snared Gandalf about his knees, and Wizard and Balrog plummeted\ntogether into the darkness below. Galdalf cried, “Fly, you fools!” and\nwas gone.\n\n Gandalf and the Balrog fell for a long\ntime, and Gandalf was burned by the Balrog's fire. Then they plunged\ninto a deep lake in the depths of the mountain, which Gandalf later said\nwas cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. They fought in\nthe water until finally the Balrog fled into dark tunnels, where the\nworld is gnawed by nameless things, older even than Sauron. Gandalf\npursued the creature until it led him to the spiraling Endless Stair,\nand they climbed it until they reached Durin's Tower in the living rock\nof Zirakzigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. There\nthey fought, until at last Gandalf threw down his enemy, and the Balrog\nbroke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Gandalf, and he\npassed away. His body lay on the peak. The entire battle, from the\nconfrontation on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm to the mutual demise of the\nBalrog and Gandalf, had taken ten days.\n\nTwenty days later Gandalf returned to life, and lay in a trance.\n\n\n\nThree days later he was found by the windlord Gwaihir, the Lord of the\nEagles, who had been sent by Galadriel to find him. Gandalf was carried\nto Caras Galadhon in Lothlórien, where he was healed, and clothed in\nwhite, and thus became Gandalf the White.\n\nIn Fangorn forest he encountered Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas while they\nwere tracking Pippin and Merry, who had been captured by orcs in\nGandalf's absence.\n\nRohan\n\nRevealing himself to the three, he explained how he had survived and\nreturned. There, Gandalf tried to persuade Aragorn to go to Rohan\ninstead, insisting there are other pressing matters, such as the War\ncoming to Rohan and the impending attack on Edoras by Saruman.\n\n\n\nArriving in Rohan with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas, Gandalf discovered\nKing Théoden, weakened by Saruman's agent, Grima Wormtongue. However,\nGandalf quickly broke Wormtongue and Saruman's hold over Théoden.\n\nWhile Théoden and the Rohirrim rode to Helm's Deep to do battle with the\nhordes of Isengard, Gandalf rode to Orthanc and asked Treebeard to\nencourage the Huorns to Assist him in defeating Saruman and his\nUruk-hai. He also rode to find Erkenbrand and his men and persuaded them\nto ride to Helm's Deep.\n\nSiege of Gondor\n\nAfter overthrowing Saruman, Gandalf broke his rival's staff and banished\nhim from the Order of Wizards. Then, against his counsel, Pippin glanced\ninto the Palantír of Orthanc that he recovered from Saruman and made\ncontact with Sauron. He then took Pippin with him to Gondor to aid in\nthe defense of the city. Along the way, Gandalf gave Pippin a brief\nhistory of Palantír, mentioning Feanor, and how it was fortunate that\nPippin made contact with Sauron instead of himself, since he was not yet\nready for a meeting with Sauron. Arriving at Minas Tirith, he met with\nDenethor II and tried to give him counsel.\n\n After Faramir's charge, the\nMorgul host assaulted the city. Gandalf provided valuable aid to the\nWhite City and bought precious time allowing the Rohirrim to save Gondor\nduring The Battle of the Pelennor Fields. When the battering ram Grond\nbreached the gates of the city, numerous trolls rushed through,\nattacking the defenders. However, Gandalf rode in and helped kill a few.\nGandalf alone stood in defiance of the Witch-King, however Gandalf's\npower was never tested. With the timely arrival of Rohan, the Witch-king\nleft to deal with the new threat. With the arrival of Rohan, and the\npleas of Pippin concerning Denethor's intention to kill Faramir and\nhimself, Gandalf rushed to Faramir's aid. Gandalf took Faramir from the\npyre and tried to deter Denethor from suicide. However, driven mad by\nhis grief and Sauron's messages via the Palantír of Minas Tirith,\nDenethor set the pyre aflame while looking into said Palantír. In grief,\nGandalf closed the doors of the chamber. Denethor later gave out a cry\nand said no more. Soon afterward, Gandalf delegated the control of the\ncity to the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n\nThe Fall of Sauron\n\n\nGandalf, alongside Aragorn, led the final battle against Sauron's forces\nat the Black Gate, waging an all-out battle to distract the Dark Lord's\nattention away from Frodo and Sam, who were at the very same moment\nscaling Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. Though the forces of good\nwere heavily outnumbered, they were able to hold back the enemy until\nthe hobbits reached the peak of Mount Doom.\n\nOn the precipice within, looking over the fires of Mount Doom, Frodo\nfinally succumbed the power of the Ring, slipping it onto his finger.\nHowever, Gollum, unable to bear the thought that the Ring would be\ndestroyed, lunged at Frodo, biting off his ring finger, and the Ring, in\nthe process. Gollum and the Ring fell into the fire, and the Ring was\nfinally destroyed. Without Gandalf's efforts, Sauron might have learned\nwhere the two hobbits were and killed them before they could have\ncompleted their task.\n\nFourth Age\n\nFour years after the ring was destroyed, Gandalf spent some time with\nthe “moss gatherer” Tom Bombadil, then, after having spent over 2,000\nyears in Middle-earth, departed with Frodo, Galadriel, Celeborn, Bilbo,\nElrond, (and presumably Shadowfax) across the sea to the Undying Lands,\nand was never seen again in Middle-earth. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Gandalf_ means “Elf of the wand” or “Wand-elf”, from old\nnorthern Mannish.\n\nWithin the Tolkien Legendarium, “Gandalf” translates an unknown name of\nthe meaning “Wand-Elf” (alternatively cane/staff) in old northern\nMannish. Most denizens of Middle-earth incorrectly assumed Gandalf was a\nMan (human), although he was really a Maia spirit (approximately\nequivalent to an angel). However, a less common misconception that\noccurred during the beginning of his career in Middle-earth was that for\nsomeone to be immortal and use as much magic as he did, he must have\nbeen an elf, although it soon became apparent to all that he couldn't be\nan elf, as he was old and elves don't generally age. Even because of\nthis, the nickname stuck with him. He later gave it as his name to\nothers he met who didn't know its original meaning.\n\nOther names\n\n-   OLÓRIN, his name in Valinor and in very ancient times. It comes from\n    the Quenya _olor_ or _olos_ (“dream”). The name could also be\n    spelled as _Olorion_.\n-   MITHRANDIR, his Sindarin name, used in Gondor and by the Elves. It\n    means “Grey Pilgrim”, from the Sindarin _mith_ (“grey”) and _ran_\n    (“wander”) or _rhandir_ (“pilgrim”).\n-   THARKÛN, given by the Dwarves), which means “Staff man”.\n-   INCÁNUS, a name of unclear language and meaning. He must have\n    acquired the name from one of his many travels in the south, near\n    Harad. Tolkien several times changed his mind about it, varying\n    between the Latin word _incanus_ (meaning Grey and a possible\n    Westron invention meaning “Greymantle”), a word _Ind-cano_ (meaning\n    Cruel Ruler), or even a form of Southron meaning “Spy of the North”.\n-   OLD GREYBEARD, by the Mouth of Sauron when they meet at the\n    Morannon.\n-   THE WHITE RIDER (when mounted on the great horse Shadowfax)\n-   STORMCROW (a reference to his arrival being associated with times of\n    trouble), often used by his detractors to mean he is a troublesome\n    meddler in the affairs of others.\n-   LATHSPELL, by Grima Wormtongue\n-   GANDALF GREYHAME\n-   THE GREY PILGRIM\n-   GANDALF THE GREY, and later GANDALF THE WHITE after he was reborn as\n    the successor to Saruman.\n-   GANDALF THE WANDERING WIZARD\n\n\nCharacter Development\n\nMythical roots\n\nThe Old Norse name “_Gandalfr_” appears in the list of dwarves in the\n_Völuspá_ of the Elder Edda; the name means “cane-elf,” or “wand-elf.”\nTolkien took the name along with the dwarves names when he wrote _The\nHobbit_ in the 1930s. He came to regret the creation of this _“rabble of\neddaic-named dwarves,  invented in an idle hour”_ (The Return of\nthe Shadow:452), since it forced him to come up with an explanation of\nwhy Old Norse names should be used in Third Age of Middle-earth. He\nsolved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that Old Norse was a\n_translation_ of the language of Dale. The figure of Gandalf has other\ninfluences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation\nas “the Wanderer”, an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide\nbrimmed hat, and a staff. Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an\n_“Odinic wanderer”_ in a letter of 1946. Gandalf is also similar to\nVäinämöinen, a Bard in Finnish mythology.\n\nDer Berggeist\n\n\n\nTolkien had a postcard labelled _Der Berggeist_ (“the mountain spirit”),\nand on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote “origin of Gandalf”\nat some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure,\nsitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a\nwide-brimmed round hat, and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling\nhis upturned hands.\n\nHumphrey Carpenter in his 1977 biography said that Tolkien had bought\nthe postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred\nZimmerman (1983) discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef\nMadlener and dates to the late 1920s. Humphrey Carpenter concluded that\nTolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself.\nTolkien must have acquired the card at some time in the early 1930s, at\na time when _The Hobbit_ had already begun to take shape.\n\nThe original painting was auctioned at Sotheby's in London on July 12,\n2005 for 84,000. The previous owner had been given the painting by\nMadlener in the 1940s and recalled that he had stated the mountains in\nthe background of the painting were the Dolomites.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nGandalf is described as an old man with a pointed blue hat, a long grey\ncloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows\nthat stuck out beyond the brim of the hat.\n\nAfter he is resurrected, the change of his signature colour from grey to\nwhite is significant, for he was sent back to replace the corrupted head\nof the Order of Wizards and leader of the White Council Saruman as the\nChief of the Order of Wizards. In the book, he says that he has himself\nbecome what Saruman should have been.\n\nCírdan the Shipwright seemed to have foreseen this, for he entrusted the\ncare of Narya, the Ring of Fire (one of the Three Rings of the Elves) to\nGandalf rather than Saruman.\n\n\nPowers and abilities\n\nGandalf the Grey displays the widest range of powers, though all other\nforms have at least this many. Though strangely, as this is more\nbefitting a Maiar of Aule, his powers are very much linked to fire. Here\nis a list of a few of the times he used fire\n\n• Heating fire\n\n• Manipulating sparks\n\n• Creating massive pillars of smoke.\n\n• Lighting a log on fire while soaking wet\n\nGandalf also created bright white light during the Fellowship's\nexpedition into Moria. He later displays the ability to focus this light\ninto a beam.\n\nGandalf also displays the ability to use Words of Command. However, he\nonly displayed this power once, when he used it to shut a door.\n\nGandalf the White displays these same powers but more advanced.\n\nHe also displayed the ability to communicate with animals, specifically\nShadowfax.\n\nFinally, he also shattered Saruman’s staff, and stripped him of his\ndivine power.\n\nAs his unrestricted form, Olorin, he had all his previous powers\nmassively boosted, and the ability to shapeshift.\n\nHowever, even this form seems to have restrictions, as the Ainur were\nsaid to have their power restricted upon descending to earth. If so his\ntrue form would be enormously beyond his other forms, possibly capable\nof destroying entire universes.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nGandalf primarily used his staff, but also carried a sword in combat.\nSometimes during combat, Gandalf would be seen wielding both weapons\nagainst his enemies.\n\nStaff\n\nGandalf utilised his staff for various spells and abilities. He didn't\nuse it just as a weapon; he also utilized a staff as if it were a\nwalking stick. He initially had an old wooden staff which he lost in the\nMines of Moria while fighting the Balrog. He used a new one upon\nbecoming Gandalf the White.\n\nGlamdring\n\nThis was an Elven sword Gandalf found in a troll cave. From that point\nuntil the resolution of the War of the Ring, he used this as a weapon to\ncomplement his staff, wielding them with equal skill. In many cases, he\nfought with both weapons at once.",

    "text": "SAURON (or _'Þauron (Thauron_'); Quenya; IPA: or Vanyarin; IPA: - “The\nAbhorred”), the eponymous LORD OF THE RINGS, was a fallen Maia, the\ncreator of the One Ring, and the most trusted lieutenant of his master\nMelkor (Morgoth, the first Dark Lord). After Melkor's defeat in the\nFirst Age, Sauron became the second Dark Lord and strove to conquer Arda\nby creating the Rings of Power. In the Second Age, he was defeated in\nthe War of the Last Alliance by the last line of defense: Elves and Men\nunder kings Gil-galad and Elendil.\n\nDuring that battle, Isildur managed to cut off Sauron's finger with the\nRing on it, causing the destruction of his corporeal form and scattering\nhis armies. After spending hundreds of years lying dormant and slowly\nregaining his strength, Sauron returned to power in the Third Age, but\nwas finally defeated in the War of the Ring through the destruction of\nthe One Ring by Frodo Baggins.\n\nHe was called GORTHAUR THE CRUEL by the other Maiar.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigin\n\n\n\nSauron was originally a Maia of Aulë the Smith; his name then was\nMAIRON, meaning “the admirable.” He learned much from Aulë in the ways\nof forging and crafting, becoming a great craftsman, and mighty in the\nlore of Aulë's people. Although he was a Maia spirit, and not as\nmighty as the Valar, Mairon was one of the most if not the most powerful\nMaiar, being far stronger than others such as Olorin and Curumo (who was\nalso a servant of Aulë).\n\nDuring this time, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and incorrupt.\nHis greatest virtue was his love of order and perfection - his dislike\nof anything wasteful. However, this would also prove to be the cause of\nhis downfall, for in the Dark Lord Morgoth, Mairon saw the will and\npower that would help him achieve his own goals and desires faster than\nif he had pursed them on his own. So great was his allegiance that even\nin later days, after Morgoth was defeated and locked outside the\nconfines of the world, Sauron encouraged and coerced some Men to worship\nMorgoth as the one and true god. However, while Morgoth wanted to either\ncontrol or destroy the very matter of Arda itself, Mairon's desire was\nto dominate the minds and wills of its creatures.\n\nAfter allying himself with Morgoth, Mairon maintained his appearance of\nbeing faithful to the Valar, but secretly fed Morgoth information about\ntheir dealings. It was only when Morgoth established his strongholds in\nMiddle-earth that Sauron left the Blessed Realms and openly declared his\nallegiance, and ever after remained a foe of the Valar and the Free\nPeoples of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Sindar in Beleriand called him GORTHAUR, meaning “dread\nabomination”, and to the Ñoldor, he was named SAURON, meaning “the\nabhorred” or “the abominable” (a mockery of his original name).\n\nFirst Age\n\nDuring the First Age, the Ñoldorin Elves left the Blessed Realm of\nValinor in the Utter West (against the counsel of the Valar) in order to\nwage war on Morgoth, who had stolen the Silmarils of Fëanor, enchanted\ngems that glowed with light from the now-destroyed Trees of Valinor. In\nthat war, Sauron was counted as the “greatest of  servants\nthat have names”. He was soon feared as a lord of terrible phantoms and\ndreadful beasts--a shape shifter, sorcerer, and a cunning servant of his\ndark master.\n\nBefore Melkor's captivity, Sauron commanded the fortress of Angband and\nserved as Melkor's lieutenant. When the Vala Tulkas came and captured\nMelkor, Sauron had already fled and was not found.\n\nWhen Morgoth left Angband to corrupt the newly awakened Atani (Men),\nSauron directed the war against the Elves. He conquered the Elvish\nisle of Tol Sirion, so that it became known as _Tol-in-Gaurhoth_, the\nIsle of Werewolves. He was the Lord of the Werewolves there, and\nDraugluin was the sire of the Werewolves. Sauron's herald was the\nvampire Thuringwethil.\n\nAfter Dagor Bragollach, Sauron's hunters brought Gorlim and questioned\nhim of Barahir's, father of Beren, location. Gorlim told them none,\nuntil Sauron himself came forth and bartered with the man. Gorlim asked\nfor his wife Eilinel, whom he thought captured. Thus, Sauron agreed and\nGorlim yielded the information. However, Sauron revealed that Eilinel\nwas dead, and he put Gorlim to death afterward. During the Quest for the\nSilmaril, Beren and Finrod King of Nargothrond were captured by Sauron.\nThere Finrod and Sauron fought songs of power. He stripped them off\ntheir Orc disguises and cast them into the dark pits where werewolves\ndevoured their companions. When a werewolf came to attack Beren, Finrod\nwrestled with it and passed away from his injuries.\n\n\n\nSoon afterward, Lúthien and Huan the wolf-hound arrived at the bridge of\nTol-in-Gaurhoth. Sauron sent wolves to capture Lúthien, but all were\nslain by Huan. One of them was Draugluin, but he fled and told his\nmaster that Huan was there. Therefore, Sauron disguised himself as a\nwerewolf and leaped to attack Lúthien. Huan sprang and subdued Sauron.\nHe yielded the tower to Lúthien and escaped in a form of a vampire.\n\nAfter his defeat by Lúthien, Sauron played little part in the events of\nthe First Age (possibly hiding from Morgoth's wrath), and after his\nmaster was defeated and taken to Valinor in chains, Sauron seemed to\nrepent and plead to Eönwë and the victorious Host of the West for mercy.\nAlthough his plea was probably genuine, Sauron was unwilling to return\nto the Utter West for judgment, and so he fled and hid somewhere in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nSecond Age\n\nForging of the One Ring\n\n[]\n\nAfter lying hidden and dormant for 500 years, he began revealing himself\nonce more, and by SA 1000 he gathered his power and established himself\nin the land of Mordor in eastern Middle-earth and began building the\ndreaded Dark Tower of Barad-dûr near Mount Doom. Sauron, like Morgoth,\nsoon began raising massive armies of Orcs, Trolls, and possibly other\ncreatures, as well as corrupting the hearts of Men with delusions of\npower and wealth, chiefly Easterlings and Southrons (the Haradrim).\n\nAlthough Sauron knew that men were easier to sway, he sought to bring\nthe Elves into his service, as they were far more powerful. By about SA\n1500, Sauron put on a fair visage in the Second Age, and calling himself\nAnnatar, the “Lord of Gifts”, he befriended the Elvish smiths of\nEregion, including Celebrimbor, greatest of craftsman as he was\ndescended from Fëanor, and counseled them in arts and magic. Not all the\nElves trusted him, particularly Lady Galadriel, Elrond, and Gil-galad,\nHigh King of the Ñoldor.\n\n\n\nTo the elves who listened, Sauron gave knowledge and encouragement in\nforging the Rings of Power, though in secret Sauron forged his own, the\nOne Ring, to rule the Elvish rings. Upon that ring Sauron left the black\nspeech inscription, _Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg\nthrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul._ In Westron the inscription\ntranslated into: _One Ring to Rule Them All, One Ring to Find Them, One\nRing to Bring Them All, and in the Darkness Bind Them._\n\nHowever, as soon as Sauron put the Ring on his finger the Elves sensed\nhis treachery, and removed their rings and hid them. Enraged, Sauron\ncame against them in open war and demanded that all the Rings of Power\nbe given to him. The Elves managed to hide the three greatest of the\nRings from him, but the other sixteen Rings of Power were either\ncaptured by Sauron, destroyed, or lost. To the Dwarves he had given\nSeven, but to Men he had given Nine, knowing that they would be the\neasiest to enslave. The Dwarf Lords who received the Rings proved to be\nvery resistant to their power, and neither “faded” nor became enslaved\nto Sauron's will. The Rings, however, created in them an insatiable lust\nfor gold, which ultimately caused a great deal of grief for the\nDwarves.\n\nAs Sauron predicted, the nine Men were all corrupted by their Rings and\nbecame the Nazgûl, Sauron's deadliest and most cruel servants. Had the\nElves not recognized Sauron's treachery and forsaken the power of their\nrings, the results would have been catastrophic for the Free Peoples of\nMiddle-earth. It seems that most if not all of the native Men of\nMiddle-earth succumbed to the power of the Ring once the Nazgûl were\ncreated; the Númenóreans were spared because of their distance. The\nElves, had they been captured in this fashion, would have become the\nslaves of Sauron, and thus Celebrimbor's resistance was of immense\nimportance in the history of Middle-earth.\n\nIn this era, during which he marshalled and commanded great armies,\nSauron became known as the Dark Lord of Mordor and his fortress of\nBarad-dûr was completed. He was very powerful even without control of\nthe Elves, and he conquered nearly all of Middle-earth during the War of\nthe Elves and Sauron. However, the armies of Númenór's King Tar-Minastir\nwere finally able to defeat him at a last battle near Gwathló or the\nGreyflood in SA 1700. Defeated but not vanquished, Sauron retreated back\nto Mordor and began recouping his strength over the many centuries.\n\n\n\nTowards the end of the Second Age, Sauron was once again powerful enough\nto raise again large armies to attempt to rule Middle-earth. By this\ntime, he assumed the titles of “LORD OF THE EARTH” and “KING OF MEN”.\nSauron's rise in power and apparent intention to crown himself the King\nof all Men offended the Númenóreans; the powerful Men descended from\nthose who had fought against Melkor in the War of Wrath. Some were the\ndescendants, through Elros, of Beren and Lúthien.\n\nLife in Númenor\n\nThese Men lived on the island of Númenor in the sea between Middle-earth\nand Valinor. The Númenóreans, who were then proud, came to Middle-earth\nwith astounding force of arms. King Ar-Pharazôn, who desired no less\nthan the kingship of Middle-earth, marched his troops all the way to\nMordor without a single battle, and demanded that Sauron abase himself\nbefore the King. Sauron could see clearly that even the most powerful of\nhis servants could not stand against the Númenóreans, and so came from\nBarad-dûr without any offer of battle. He assumed a fair form and\nflattered Ar-Pharazôn, but the King demanded that Sauron come back to\nNúmenor as a hostage. Sauron feigned unhappiness at this development but\nsecretly was delighted, for this presented him with an opportunity to\ndestroy the Númenóreans from within. After only a few short years in\nNúmenor he grew from captive to the King's most trusted adviser, and\nnearly all the King's court fawned upon him. Drawing on their fear of\ndeath, he converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Morgoth, lying\nthat Morgoth had the power to save them from mortality. As his power and\ninfluence reached its peak, he raised a great Temple in which he\nperformed human sacrifices to Morgoth. Finally, he convinced Ar-Pharazôn\nto rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself and claim it for\nhimself.\n\nBut here, Sauron's cunning overreached itself, for Eru then directly\nintervened - Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of\nNúmenor was destroyed and the army that reached Aman was buried under\nmountains of falling rock and imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten.\nThe world was bent, so that thereafter, only Elven-Ships could sail into\nthe Utter West. Sauron's body was destroyed, but his spirit was not\ndiminished, and he fled back to Mordor bearing the Ring, where he slowly\nrebuilt a new body and his strength during the time known as the Dark\nYears. From this point on, he lost the ability to assume a fair shape,\nand ruled now through terror and force. A few faithful Númenóreans led\nby Elendil were saved from the flood, and they founded Gondor and Arnor\nin Middle-earth.\n\nLoss of the Ring\n\n\n\nAfter learning that Elendil, whom he had most hated, had survived and\nwas ordering a realm on his borders, Sauron, after a while, made war\nwith them. He struck too soon, however, and had not restored most of his\nstrength, whereas the Elven-king, Gil-galad had increased his power on\nMiddle-earth in his absence. Therefore, when Gil-Galad allied with\nElendil to create the Last Alliance and together fought Sauron, they\nfinally defeated his armies at the Battle of Dagorlad, and laid siege to\nBarad-dûr for seven years. Finally, Sauron himself came forth and dueled\nboth Elendil and Gil-galad, slaying them both singlehandedly. Then\nIsildur, son of Elendil, took up his father's broken sword, Narsil and\ncut the One Ring from Sauron's finger. Sauron's physical body was\ndestroyed. With nearly all of his power stored in the ring, he was\nvanquished when it was cut from his finger. Without their leader's dark\nwill driving them on, Sauron's armies were routed and fled, and thus,\nhis campaign to defeat the free peoples was seemingly ended, and his\ngreatest weapon taken from him.\n\nBut while Isildur had taken the ring, he could not bring himself to\ndestroy it in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged, instead he\nbecame corrupted by the One Ring and kept it for himself. He was\neventually betrayed by it a few years later, and slain by Orcs at\nGladden Fields. The Ring fell into the river Anduin, and was lost for\ncenturies before being found by the two Stoorish friends Smeagol and\nDéagol.\n\nThird Age\n\nDespite his defeat, Sauron was not vanquished permanently. Though\ngreatly weakened, and in non-corporeal form, he still existed, due to\npouring most of his native power, strength, and will into the One Ring.\nThus, as long as it existed, he could never be truly defeated, and\nduring the first thousand years of the Third Age, he lay in hiding,\nslowly recovering his strength until he was once again able to create a\nbody for himself.\n\nThe Necromancer of Dol Guldur\n\n\n\nIn the year TA 1000, Sauron at last began to rise again, taking the\nstronghold of Dol Guldur, the Hill of Sorcery, in southern Mirkwood in\nTA 1050. There, he was disguised as a dark sorcerer known as “THE\nNECROMANCER”, and the Elves did not realize at first that he was\nactually Sauron returned.\n\nAround this time, the Valar sent the five Wizards, or Istari, including\nGandalf Greyhame, who later changed into Gandalf the White, to oppose\nSauron and rally the free peoples of Middle-earth against him.\n\nWhile Sauron continued to gather his strength, the Ringwraiths\nreappeared in the year TA 1300, and began steadily assaulting the\nNumenorian kingdoms in exile until, one by one, they fell. Whether the\nWitch King was acting on his own, or was being guided by Sauron, is not\nknown.\n\nSuspecting that Sauron had returned and was guiding the Nazgûl, the\nwizard Gandalf infiltrated the fortress in TA 2063 to confirm his\ntheory, but Sauron fled into the East to conceal his identity. This\nmarked the beginning of the Watchful Peace, which ended with Sauron's\nreturn to Dol Guldur in TA 2460. During the same year, the One Ring was\nfinally discovered by the stoor Smeagol and his friend Deagol.\n\n\n\nGandalf the Grey made a second intrusion into Dol Guldur in TA 2850, and\nfinally discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. Eventually,\nthe White Council put forth their might and drove Sauron from Dol Guldur\npermanently in TA 2941. Without the Ring in his possession, Sauron could\ndraw on only the smallest fraction of its strength, so that his enemies\nwere able to drive him from Dol Guldur with relative ease. However, the\nDark Lord, having had ample time to prepare, was willing to abandon Dol\nGuldur, and returned to Mordor, where he openly declared himself in TA\n2951, and began preparations for his final war against the free peoples\nof Middle-earth.\n\nSauron bred immense armies of Orcs and allied with and enslaved Men from\nthe east and south. He gathered his most terrifying servants, the Nazgûl\n(_airi_ in Quenyan), or Ringwraiths, each wearing one of the nine rings\ndesigned for mortal men. He adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and was\nable to exert his will over Middle-earth, so that the Eye of Sauron\nbecame a symbol of power and fear.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nAfter the creature Gollum, who had previously possessed the ring, was\ncaptured, Sauron had him tortured and learned that he once had a magic\nring, and from him he heard the words _Shire_ and _Baggins_. He deduced\nthat Gollum's ring was the One Ring, and sent his servants, the dreaded\nNazgûl, to find _Shire_ and search for _Baggins,_ so that the One Ring\nmight be found and returned to him.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sauron had allied with Saruman the White (another fallen\nMaia, or Istari), whom he had ensnared into his service, expecting the\nwizard to move against Rohan and thus remove one of the major threats\nSauron faced in his planned conquest of Gondor and the remaining Elves.\nSaruman failed however, and Sauron lost his most potent ally as well as\nSaruman's massive orc army of Uruk-hai.\n\nShortly after Saruman's defeat, Peregrin Took looked into the Palantír\nthat Saruman had possessed and accidentally communicated with Sauron,\nwho believed that Saruman had captured either the Halflings bearing the\nRing, or some who might know of it. However, shortly thereafter Aragorn\ntook the Palantir and revealed himself to Sauron with the intent of\ncausing him unease. Upon seeing Aragorn, Sauron realized that Saruman\nhad fallen and concluded that the heir of Isildur carried the One Ring.\nFearful that his enemies would use the Ring against him, Sauron sped up\nhis plans and attacked the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor sooner than he\nhad planned, seeking to raze the city and crush last true human\nresistance to his rule before his enemies could fortify it.\n\nFortunately, due to the combined efforts of Gondor, Rohan, and the\nDúnedain of Arnor, Sauron's army was defeated. Despite still possessing\nmore than enough armies to destroy Minas Tirith and enough military\nstrength to easily conquer Middle-earth once Gondor fell, doubt began to\ngrow on Sauron. As such, he watched and waited, hoping for a period of\nstrife between Aragorn and other potential Ringlords in which he could\nmove out and take the Ring for himself.\n\nDownfall\n\nDespite their successful repulsion of Sauron's armies at Minas Tirith,\nGandalf and Aragorn knew that the bulk of Sauron's forces remained in\nMordor, readying themselves for another, deadlier strike against the\ncity. Filled as Mordor was with Sauron's troops, Frodo stood almost no\nchance of reaching Mt. Doom undetected. In light of the situation,\nAragorn called for a council consisting of the major commanders of all\nthe forces present in Minas Tirith, and appointed Gandalf to be their\noverlord until the crisis had passed. Gandalf made it clear to all those\npresent that, despite their great victory, they ultimately could not\nhope to defeat Sauron's armies by force. Therefore, they had two options\navailable. They could station their remaining force, considerably\ngreater than it had been before the battle due to the reinforcements\nfrom Rohan and southern Gondor, at Minas Tirith and hope to endure\nSauron's next attack. Or, they could take a force to the Black Gate and\nattempt to challenge Sauron directly. This force, as Gandalf suggested,\nwould only need to be great enough to challenge battle, and the rest of\ntheir forces could remain behind to garrison Minas Tirith. This option,\nthough suicidal for all those involved, would serve to distract Sauron\nfrom gazing into his own land, through which the Ringbearer would be\ntrekking. Furthermore, Gandalf theorized that once Sauron learned that a\nforce too small to pose any real threat to him was on its way to the\nBlack Gate to directly assault Mordor, that he would likely believe that\nwhomever was leading the attacking force would have the One Ring in\ntheir possession. Gandalf believed that Sauron would assume that the\nRing itself would influence its wielder, and that in the wielder's pride\nin his newfound power, he might be foolish enough to challenge Sauron's\nmight with a force too small to assault Mordor in earnest.\n\nTheir ploy worked, as Sauron marshaled most of his remaining forces and\nmarched them towards Udun to crush the Men of the West and regain his\nprize. This action left the Plains of Gorgoroth largely deserted and\nallowing Frodo and Sam to reach Mt. Doom with far less difficulty than\nthey would have otherwise had. However, once Frodo reached the Crack of\nDoom, he finally succumbed to the power of the Ring. As he put it on and\nprepared to leave Mt. Doom, Sauron suddenly became aware of him,\nimmediately drawing his gaze towards the mountain. Though enraged,\nSauron was suddenly gripped with terror having realized his own folly,\nand he frantically sent the Ringwraiths towards the mountain to retrieve\nthe Ring. He was too late however, and Gollum, after taking the Ring\nfrom Frodo, slipped and plunged into the Cracks of Doom, and the Ring\nwas unmade. The earth shook as a great shockwave rippled across Mordor,\nand the foundations of Barad-dûr were finally destroyed, causing the\ngreat fortress to fall into ruin once and for all. Mt. Doom was\ncompletely destroyed in a cataclysmic eruption that consumed the eight\nremaining Nazgul, who had left their combat with the Great Eagles to\nrace to Mount Doom, in its fiery ruin.\n\nWith his source of power gone, Sauron was utterly defeated and his\narmies were destroyed or scattered, bereft of the driving will behind\ntheir conquest. With the Ring's destruction, Sauron was permanently\nrobbed of his physical form, reducing him to a malevolent spirit that\nhovered above Mordor as a “huge shape of shadow, impenetrable,\nlightning-crowned, ...terrible but impotent,” only to be blown away by a\ngreat wind.\n\n\n\nWith the destruction of the Ring, the vast majority of Sauron's being\nand his power was forever lost. With that, Sauron's power was forever\ncrippled, and the threat of his dominion was forever removed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_SAURON_ is the Quenya term for “the Abhorred”. In Sindarin, it is\ntranslated as _GORTHAUR_ from _gor_ (“horror, dread”) and _thaur_\n(“abominable, abhorrent”).\n\nOther names\n\nHis original name was said to be MAIRON (“the Admirable”, from _maira_\nmeaning “admirable, excellent”), a name he used while in Númenor, adding\nthe title “Tar” for “Tar-Mairon” (“King Excellent”). When disguising\nhimself in the Second Age, he called himself ANNATAR (“Lord of Gifts,\n_anna_ = gift and _tar_ = king, lord”), ARTANO (“High-smith”), and\nAULENDIL (“Friend of Aulë”).\n\nHis name is sometimes seen written as THAURON (ÞAURON), an earlier\npronunciation of _Sauron_.\n\nTitles\n\n-   THE ENEMY\n-   THE NAMELESS ENEMY\n-   THE DECEIVER\n-   THE DARK LORD (Post-First Age)\n-   THE LORD OF BARAD-DÛR\n-   THE LORD OF MORDOR\n-   THE NECROMANCER (First Age/Third Age)\n\nEarlier names\n\nTHÛ was Tolkien's earliest name for Sauron, in the original Lay of\nLeithian. Thu is reintroduced as an alternate name for Sauron in Beren\nand Luthien (2017).\n\n_TEVILDO_, before that, was the name of the forerunner character to\nSauron, a “Prince of Cats” who is a villain told of in the stories of\n_The Book of Lost Tales_. In Beren and Luthien (2017) Tevildo is\npresented as a separate character from Thu/Sauron, and one of Morgoth's\nother minions.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nDespite being the title character of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron is\nnotable in that he never directly appears during the events of the\ntrilogy. Nowhere is any detailed description given of what he looks\nlike, other than in vague terms.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, however, Sauron is described as being a shape\nchanger, and took many forms, including that of a serpent, a vampire,\nand a great wolf. After Morgoth's fall, Sauron appeared in fair form as\n“Annatar”, the Lord of Gifts, and maintained this appearance until the\nFall of Númenor, in which he was unable to ever take fair form ever\nagain. _The History of Middle-earth_ includes a passage vaguely\ndescribing how the Númenoreans saw him: “Upon that ship which was cast\nhighest and stood dry upon a hill there was a man, but greater than any\neven of the race of Numenor in stature...And it seemed to men that\nSauron was great; though they feared the light of his eyes. To many he\nappeared fair, to others terrible; but to some evil.”\nA few clues are given as to Sauron's appearance as the Dark Lord, after\nhe lost his ability to take a fair form: Tolkien described Sauron in one\nof his letters as having the form of a man of more than human stature,\nbut not gigantic, and as an image of malice and hatred made visible. He\napparently gave off great heat, so much so that Gil-galad was burned to\ndeath by his mere touch, and Isildur described Sauron's hand as black,\nyet burning like fire, suggesting that his entire body was blackened\nfrom fire and heat.\n\nGollum, having apparently seen Sauron directly, described him as having\nonly four fingers on his black hand, suggesting that Sauron was unable\nto regenerate the finger from which Isildur took the One Ring, similar\nto how the wounds Morgoth took from Fingolfin never healed. He was not\nconfined to a flaming eye in a tower.\n\nIn addition to his physical appearance, Sauron also apparently had an\naura of incredible malevolence. A passage in _The Silmarillion_\ndescribes him as having a “dreadful presence,” and daunting eyes.\nFurthermore, his mere presence could bend all but the strongest\nwills.\n\nRegarding Sauron's personality, Tolkien had this to say from his\nletters:\n\nPhilosopher and Tolkien scholar Peter J. Kreeft proposes that Sauron is\nin fact the main character of _The Lord of the Rings_, inasmuch as he\nhas the largest significance to the work of good and evil in the story,\ngiven his shared essence with the Ring; and given the title's referral\nto him.\n\n\nWeapons and powers\n\nSauron was among the mightiest of the Maiar. Originally of Aulë's\npeople, he acquired great “scientific” knowledge of the world's\nsubstances and how to use them. He would retain this knowledge\nthroughout his tenure as the Dark Lord in Middle-earth, using it to\nforge the One Ring and construct his fortress of Barad-dûr. Sauron also\nseemed primarily linked to the use of fire, and as Morgoth's chief\nlieutenant, his ability to tap into the fires in the earth was of great\nvalue.\n\n\n\nAmong Sauron's chief powers were deception and disguise: In the First\nAge Sauron took on many forms. His battle against Luthien and Huan in\n_The Silmarillion_ has him taking on no less than four separate shapes:\nhis “normal” shape, presumed to be that of some kind of terrible dark\nsorcerer, a great wolf, a serpent, and finally a vampire “dripping blood\nfrom his throat upon the trees” (“Of Beren and Lúthien,” _The\nSilmarillion_). At the end of the First Age, Sauron took on a fair form\nto appeal to the Captain of the Hosts of the Valar and ask for pardon.\nIn the Second Age, Sauron took up that fair form again and used it under\nthe alias “Annatar” to deceive the Elves into creating the Rings of\nPower. The level of deception required to fool the Elves of Eregion must\nhave gone beyond simply taking on a fair form. Sauron was literally\ninstructing the Elves to make artifacts that while capable of great\ngood, were ultimately purposed for his own domination and were imbued\nwith power to arrest the natural order of the world. The Elves were\nunaware of who they were dealing with until the eleventh hour, and only\nnarrowly escaped his trap. Centuries later, Sauron was able to deceive\nthe Númenóreans and steer them directly to their own destruction under\npromises of eternal life. Such destruction is a testament to Sauron's\nmanipulative nature and ability to twist the perceptions of his enemies.\n\n\n\nAn interesting dichotomy is set up between his deceptive nature and his\nsymbol. While rarely appearing personally and deceiving all but the most\nwary, he represented himself as an all seeing eye that could pierce all\ndisguises. He himself was able to disguise himself by changing shape and\ntaking a fair form. But after the Fall of Númenor he was incapable of\ntaking physical form for many years, and then later became a horrific\nDark Lord. After losing the Ring it took even longer for him to regain\nphysical form, although by the War of the Ring he had regained it.\n\nThe extent, nature, and specifics of Sauron's power are largely left to\nthe imagination. Like his master Morgoth, he was capable of altering the\nphysical substance of the world around him by mere effort of will.\n\n\nSigns and Symbols\n\nThe Symbol of Sauron was the _Eye of Sauron_, particularly after he\narose in Mirkwood at Dol Guldur.

    "text": "'''Melkor '''(Quenya; IPA: “He who arises in might”), later known\npredominantly as '''Morgoth ''', was the first Dark Lord, and the\nprimordial source of evil in Eä.\n\nOriginally the most powerful of the Ainur created by Eru Iluvatar,\nMelkor rebelled against his creator out of pride and sought to corrupt\nArda. After committing many evils in the First Age, such as the theft of\nthe Silmarils, which resulted in his name Morgoth, and the destruction\nof the Two Lamps and the Two Trees of Valinor, Morgoth was defeated by\nthe Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath and cast out of Arda into the\nVoid, where he now waits.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAinulindalë\n\n\n\nMelkor was created by Eru Iluvatar in the Timeless Halls, at the\nbeginning of creation. His brother was Manwë, although Melkor was\ngreater in power and knowledge than any of the Ainur.\n\nImpatient with the emptiness of the Great Void outside the Timeless\nHalls, and desiring to create things of his own, Melkor often went forth\ninto the Void in search of the Flame Imperishable. But the Flame was of\nIluvatar and resided with him, and Melkor never discovered it. He\ncontinued to search, however, and as such was often alone and apart from\nhis fellow Ainur. It was during these lonesome periods that Melkor began\nto have ideas and thoughts of his own that were not in accordance with\nhis fellow Ainur.\n\n\n\nWhen the Ainur sang the Great Music before Eru, Melkor wove some of\nthese alien thoughts into his music, and straightaway Discord arose\naround him. Some of those nearby attuned their music to his, until two\nmusical themes were warring before the Throne. To correct the Discord,\nEru introduced a Second, and then a Third Theme into the music. But\nMelkor succeeded in holding back the Second theme, of which Manwë was\nthe chief instrument. The Third was the theme of Elves and Men, and\nwhile it was not overwhelmed by the Discord as the Second theme was, it\ntoo failed to correct it. When Eru brought the Music to an end, he\nrebuked Melkor, praising his strength but reminding him that, as an\naspect of his creator's thought, anything that Melkor could bring into\nbeing ultimately had its source within Eru himself. As such, even the\nDiscord redounded in the end to the glory of Eru's work. This rebuke\nshamed Melkor, but brought on anger in him as well, though he hid it.\nThus when the Music was made incarnate as Arda, it was already flawed\nthrough the Discord, and immoderate heat and great cold stalked it.\nMelkor then took in the interest of the World and descended to it with\nthe other Valar.\n\nArrival in Arda\n\nWhen the Valar entered into Arda and began to shape the unwrought\nmatter, Melkor saw the Field of Arda and claimed it for his own.\nHowever, the other Valar took Manwë to be their lord, for while Manwë\nwas not nearly so powerful as Melkor, he understood the thought of Eru\nbetter than any of his peers. Bitter, Melkor set himself against the\nother Valar. Whenever the Valar worked to better the world, Melkor\ndisrupted their efforts. For a long while, Melkor fought alone against\nthe might of all the other Valar and Maiar of Arda, and he long held the\nupper hand. During this time, Arda was kept essentially shapeless, as\nMelkor ruined virtually every early work that the other Valar attempted\nto create. Fortunately for them, the mighty Valar Tulkas eventually\ndescended to Arda, and his strength tipped the balance in favor of the\nValar. Melkor fled before him, and left Arda for a time.\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\nAfter Melkor's departure, the Valar managed to quiet the tumults of the\nworld, and set about ordering it in preparation for the coming of the\nElves. To give light to the world, they constructed two Great Lamps in\nMiddle-earth and set their place of dwelling in the midst of them.\nDuring this time, Melkor re-entered Arda with the various Maiar spirits\nwho had attuned themselves to his music, and delved a mighty fortress at\nthe very north-most part of the World and named it Utumno. To defend\nit he raised the Mountains of the East in the northeast of Middle-earth,\neast of the Sea of Helcar. Decay arose in the North, and the Valar thus\nknew that Melkor had returned. Before they could begin to search for him\nhowever, Melkor came forth from Utumno with sudden war, and cast down\nthe Lamps. The fire within the Lamps scorched a great portion of the\nworld, and containing the catastrophe caused by their breaking kept the\nValar occupied long enough for Melkor and his forces to retreat back to\nUtumno.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Lamps, the Valar withdrew to the continent\nof Aman and there built Valinor. In doing so, however, they gave Melkor\nvirtually free-reign in Middle-earth. As a result, the continent\nlanguished in darkness, and Melkor filled its lands with terrible\ncreatures and decay. During this time, Melkor built his second, lesser\nfortress of Angband in the west, as a defense from the West should the\nValar attack. Angband was delved into the Iron Mountains, and was given\nto Sauron to command. While the Valar were unsure where the Children\nof Ilúvatar would awake, they were reluctant to wage war against Melkor,\nfearing the clash of powers might result in massive collateral damage\nthe likes of which they had not seen since the Lamps were destroyed. As\nsuch, most of them remained in Aman and forsook Middle-earth. Due to\nthis, Melkor discovered the Elves before the other Valar, captured many\nof them, and transformed them by torture and other foul craft into orcs.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nWhen it was discovered by the Vala Oromë where the Elves were, the Valar\ntook immediate action against Melkor, instigating the War of the Powers.\nThe Valar overcame the hosts of Melkor and he retreated into Utumno.\nAfter a grievous siege, the Valar rent the doors open and Melkor was\ncaptured. Melkor was bound with Angainor and brought back to Valinor.\nThere, he pleaded for pardon, but was cast into the Halls of Mandos for\nthree Ages. However, in their haste to overthrow Melkor, the Valar left\nmany of Utumno's pits and vaults unexplored, and Sauron remained at\nlarge. Additionally, they did not capture or destroy the Balrogs, who\ngathered at the ruins of Angband and went into a long hibernation,\nawaiting Melkor's return.\n\nAfter the passing of the Ages, Melkor was brought before Manwë, and\nfeigned repentance. Unable to comprehend the evil of Melkor, being\nhimself free of it, Manwë ordered him released. At first, it seemed as\nthough the evil of Melkor had been cured, for all who sought his counsel\nand aid in that time benefited greatly from it. However, Tulkas and Ulmo\nwere both very slow to forget Melkor's evils, and watched him closely.\nIn truth, Melkor was more filled with malice than ever, and began to put\nhis extraordinary cunning to use in devising a way to ruin Aman. Seeing\nthe bliss of the Elves and remembering that it was for their sake that\nhe was overthrown, Melkor desired above all things to corrupt them. Of\nall the three primary groups of Elves, he found the Ñoldor to have a\nperfect balance of usefulness and open ears, and so worked his malice\nalmost exclusively among them.\n\nOver a long period of time he spread lies concerning the intentions of\nthe Valar in bringing the Elves to Aman, telling them, among other\nthings, tales of the coming of Men, the existence of which the Valar had\nnot revealed to the Elves. Due to his carefully crafted lies, many of\nthe Ñoldor began to believe that the Valar had brought them to Aman so\nthat Men might inherit Middle-earth, taking the lands and the glory that\ncould have been theirs. Eventually, a shadow fell upon the Ñoldor, and\nthey began to openly rebel against the Valar. Chief amongst the\ndisgruntled Noldor was Fëanor, the firstborn son of the Ñoldor King\nFinwë. Though he hated and feared Melkor, his overwhelming pride caused\nhim to be the most vocal of the Ñoldor in expressing discontent. For\ntheir part, the Valar remained unaware of Melkor's work, and saw Fëanor\nas the source of the Ñoldor's unrest. Though perturbed, they let the\nsituation continue until Fëanor threatened his brother Fingolfin with\nviolence, at which point the Valar summoned him to the Ring of Doom in\nValinor to explain his unlawful actions.\n\nFëanor's testimony revealed the lies of Melkor, and Tulkas immediately\nleft the Ring of Doom to recapture him. But Melkor could not be found.\nAfter a time, Melkor went to Formenos and feigned friendship to Fëanor\nin order to acquire the Silmarils. But Fëanor, seeing Melkor's greed,\nrefused him and shut the doors of Formenos in the face of Arda's\nmightiest being. Melkor then passed unseen to the south, and came upon\nUngoliant. Promising to sate her unrelenting hunger, she and Melkor came\nback to Valinor, intending to destroy the Trees. Then, during a time of\nfestival, Melkor and Ungoliant suddenly attacked. Melkor thrust a great\nspear into the Trees and Ungoliant drank the sap that poured from the\nwounds, draining the Trees and poisoning them. The Trees quickly\nwithered and died, plunging Aman into complete darkness for a time.\n\n\n\nIn the fear and confusion that followed, Melkor sped to Formenos and\nbroke into the fortress. There, he slew Finwë, father of Fëanor, and\nstole the Silmarils along with all the other gems that lay there. The\nSilmarils burned Melkor's hand, causing him immeasurable agony, but he\ndid not release them. He and Ungoliant fled to the North, and the Valar\ngave chase, but the Unlight of Ungoliant bewildered them and the two\nescaped. The two thieves crossed the Grinding Ice of the Helcaraxë and\nentered into Middle-earth, completing Melkor's revenge.\n\nIn Lammoth, Melkor and Ungoliant approached the ruins of Angband, with\nMelkor hoping to escape and leave his promise to feed Ungoliant\nunfulfilled. Ungoliant however, saw through his plan and stopped with\nhim before they reached Angband. She demanded that he surrender the\ntreasure of Formenos to sate her hunger as he had promised, and\nbegrudgingly he gave her the lesser treasures he had taken, but he would\nnot give her the Silmarils which lay hidden within his right hand. With\nhis refusal to surrender the Silmarils, Ungoliant attacked Melkor,\nweaving her dark webbing about him. His resulting cry of pain and\nanguish roused the Balrogs from their slumber in the darkest depths of\nAngband. With a tempest of fire they came to his aid, and drove away\nUngoliant, but Melkor recalled them, and thus Ungoliant escaped. He then\nbegan to rebuild Angband, and to gather his servants there.\n\nWhen Fëanor found his father was slain, he cursed Melkor and named him\n_Morgoth_, meaning “Dark Enemy”, and by that name was he known ever\nafter. The name Melkor was never spoken again by his enemies.\n\nAs Morgoth finished rebuilding Angband, the slag and debris created by\nhis vast tunnelings was plied into three huge volcanoes, collectively\nknown as Thangorodrim. He hastened then to rebuild his forces, breeding\ninnumerable Orcs and other fell beasts.\n\nFirst Age\n\nIn Beleriand\n\n\n\nFëanor followed Morgoth to Middle-earth with the greater part of the\nÑoldor in rebellion, hoping to recover the Silmarils. This action\ntriggered the tragic War of the Great Jewels, in which the elves would\nbe utterly defeated in the end.\n\nUpon learning of the arrival of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, Morgoth sent\narmies of orcs against Fëanor's host, hoping to destroy them before they\ncould establish any viable defenses. Though the Ñoldor were outnumbered,\nthey swiftly and completely destroyed the orcs; only a handful returned\nto Angband. But Fëanor, in his pride and arrogance, thought to come at\nMorgoth himself and pursued them. Soon, he and his vanguard drew far\nahead of the main host, and the orcs, seeing this, turned and gave\nbattle at the gates of Angband. Due to their proximity to Angband, a\nnumber of Balrogs emerged to aid the orcs, and the elves with Fëanor\nwere quickly killed. Fëanor fought on alone, but was eventually struck\ndown by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs. Though a relief force under\nthe command of his sons saved him from being killed on the field of\nbattle, Fëanor's wounds were mortal and he perished soon after.\n\nShortly after Fëanor's death, Morgoth sent an embassy to the Noldor\noffering terms of surrender, even promising a Silmaril. Maedhros agreed\nto the parley, but both sides, expecting treachery, came with greater\nforce than was agreed. Unfortunately for the Elves, Morgoth's force was\nthe greater of the two, and was accompanied by Balrogs. The Elven\ncompany was quickly slain with the exception of Maedhros, who was\ncaptured and chained by his right hand to one of Thangorodrim's many\ncliffs. Morgoth sent word to the Ñoldor, promising to release\nMaedhros on the condition that the Elves would depart from the North and\ncease their war against him. However, the Elves knew that Morgoth would\nnot honor his word, and sent no reply.\n\n\n\nIt was at this time that the host of Fingolfin, which had been betrayed\nand abandoned by Fëanor's host in Aman, came at last to Middle-earth.\nTension between the two hosts quickly developed and Morgoth, seeing that\nthe Noldor were divided, made plans to destroy his distracted foes. To\nhis dismay however, the Valar revealed the creation of the Sun and the\nMoon, which confounded Morgoth and his servants for a time. To counter\nthese new lights, Morgoth sent up nigh-impenetrable clouds of smoke from\nthe Iron Mountains to darken Hithlum.\n\nDuring the time of confusion and inaction among Morgoth's forces by\nthese new lights, Fingon traveled to Angband, aided by the very darkness\nMorgoth had set upon Hithlum, and rescued Maedhros. In doing so, he set\ninto motion a series of events that united the Noldor and allowed them\nto establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand and Hithlum. When Morgoth\ninitiated his next offensive, the Ñoldor swiftly and completely\ndestroyed his forces and set a siege upon Angband, hoping to forever\ncontain the evil of Morgoth. When he had waited many years, Morgoth made\ntrial of his foes, causing the Iron Mountains to erupt and sending an\narmy of orcs down through the passes, but to no avail, for the orcs were\neasily defeated by the Noldor. After this failure, Morgoth took to\ncapturing what elves he could, breaking them with the power of his will\nand chaining their lives to his. These Elves became his spies among the\nÑoldor, and they kept him appraised of the movements and plans of his\nenemies.\n\n\n\nOne hundred years later, Morgoth sent an army into the north to approach\nHithlum from the side, but an army under the command of Fingon destroyed\nthem yet again. At this point, Morgoth came to realize that the orcs\nunaided were no match for the Ñoldor, and began experimenting with ways\nto create deadlier creatures for his armies. Another century passed, and\nthe issuing of the first dragon, Glaurung, demonstrated the results of\nMorgoth's long labor. Glaurung's sudden appearance scattered the elves\nin the immediate vicinity of Angband, but a company of archers under\nFingon's command engaged him before he could do much more than frighten\nthe elves. As Glaurung was barely half-grown, his hide was not yet\ninvulnerable to the elven arrows and he fled the field. Morgoth was\ndispleased with Glaurung for revealing himself before his creator had\nplanned, but ultimately Glaurung's youthful foray was of little\nconsequence.\n\nSome time later, when men first arrived in Beleriand, it was revealed\nthat Morgoth had left Angband and walked among the fathers of men.\nHoping to corrupt them to his service, he spread his lies among them,\nand found them to be considerably easier to sway than the elves had\nbeen. However, the strengthening of the elven kingdoms worried Morgoth,\nand he returned to Angband before his labors were complete.\nNevertheless, most Men believed or half-believed his lies and either\ndeparted from the North or joined with Morgoth's forces. However, a\nsmall group of men that became known as the Edain resisted him. They\nprovided the elves with vital intelligence as to the doings of Morgoth\nin the North, as many of their hardiest chose to live within sight of\nAngband's gates.\n\nDagor Bragollach\n\nAbout 455 years after Fingolfin came to Middle-earth, Morgoth deemed\nthat the time was ripe to destroy the elves and their allies. One cold\nwinter night, when the elven watch was least vigilant, Morgoth sent\nforth terrible rivers of fire and lava from Thangorodrim and poisonous\nfumes from the Iron Mountains. The Elves were completely unprepared for\nsuch an assault, and a great many Ñoldor perished on the Ard-galen, as\nthe fires consumed it and transformed it into a lifeless wasteland,\nforever after known as the Anfauglith. In the wake of these fires there\ncame Glaurung, now fully grown, the Balrogs, and armies of orcs and\nother monsters in numbers such as the elves had never conceived of. Thus\nbegan the Dagor Bragollach. The Siege of Angband was swiftly broken and\nthe forces of the elves were scattered. So swift and overwhelming was\nMorgoth's assault that the various elven kingdoms were unable to marshal\ntheir forces in any sort of unified front, and as such Morgoth was able\nto engage the elven forces in a piecemeal fashion, greatly blunting the\neffectiveness of any resistance. \n\nWith the exception of Maedhros and his fortress upon the Hill of\nHimring, the sons of Fëanor and Finarfin were overthrown and utterly\ndefeated. Fingolfin and Fingon only just barely managed to defend\nHithlum from Morgoth's onslaught, as the mountains surrounding it\nprovided an effective barrier against Morgoth's fires. The elves were\ncompletely driven from the forests of Dorthonion, and many of the grey\nelves forsook the war altogether and went to Doriath. When news came to\nFingolfin of the totality of the disasters that had befallen the elven\nforces, a great despair came upon him. Believing the Noldor to have been\ndefeated beyond any hope of recovery, he rode forth alone from Hithlum\nto the gates of Angband in a wrath so potent that he was said to have\nresembled Oromë himself. When he arrived, he smote upon the doors of\nMorgoth's fortress, challenging the Dark Lord to come forth to single\ncombat. Though Morgoth did not wish to, Fingolfin's challenge was heard\nby all in Angband, and was given in such an insulting manner that to\nignore it would have been to lose face before his captains.\n\nMorgoth issued forth in black armor from Angband to confront Fingolfin.\nWielding the terrible hammer Grond, Morgoth repeatedly attempted to\nsmite the elven king, but succeeded only in carving many fiery pits in\nthe ground from his missed strikes. Fingolfin long managed to avoid\nMorgoth's blows, and wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But at last,\nFingolfin grew weary, and Morgoth thrice drove him to his knees.\nFingolfin arose each time to continue the fight, but eventually he fell\nbackwards into one of the many pits formed by Morgoth's missed attacks.\nMorgoth then set his foot upon Fingolfin's neck and killed him, but not\nbefore Fingolfin, with his last stroke, hewed Morgoth's foot with his\nsword. Then Morgoth broke the elf's body and prepared to feed it to his\nwolves. But Thorondor, the King of the Eagles, swooped down upon\nMorgoth, marring his face with his talons, and rescued the body of the\nelf-king.\n\nFingolfin's last stroke gave Morgoth a permanent limp, and the pain of\nhis seven wounds could not be healed, nor were the scars ever erased.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite his great victory, Morgoth had made a critical mistake.\nSo great had been his malice and his desire to destroy the elves that he\nhad struck before his plans were fully realized, and in his hatred and\ncontempt he had underestimated the resolve and valor of his foes. Now\nMorgoth found that the elves and Edain, recovering from the initial\nshock of his onslaught, had begun to make small gains against his\noutlying forces. He therefore checked his advance, and withdrew the main\nhost of the orcs to Angband. For though he knew that his victory had\nbeen relatively decisive, his own losses had been as numerous as the\nlosses that had been accrued by the elves. Afterwards, Morgoth sent out\nmany spies, and he sent messengers to men, feigning pity. When the Edain\nrefused his false offers of peace, he summoned the Easterlings over the\nBlue Mountains to harass them militarily. Seven years passed before\nMorgoth renewed his offensive. He assailed Hithlum with great strength\nbut just as he was on the verge of victory, Círdan and a host under his\ncommand came at the last moment and helped Fingon to turn the orcs back.\n====The Quest of the Silmaril====\n\nSome time later, the elven-maiden Lúthien and her human lover Beren,\nseeking to recover a Silmaril, came disguised to Morgoth's court.\nMorgoth was able to see through her disguise, but she was undaunted by\nhis eyes, and offered to sing for him. As she sang, Morgoth conceived a\nlust and an evil more abominable than any he had yet committed, and\nallowed her to continue singing. But as he delighted in his thought,\nsuddenly shadow hid her, and she sang a song of great and terrible power\nthat cast a spell of sleep.\n\n\n\nAll Morgoth's court was cast down in slumber by her song, but the\nSilmarils burned, and became so heavy that the head of Morgoth sagged\nupon his chest. He fell from his throne, the Iron Crown rolled away from\nhim, and Beren cut a Silmaril from it. However, rather than leaving\nimmediately with his prize, he tried to take another of the Silmarils.\nAs he attempted to pry the second jewel loose, his knife snapped. One\nshard struck Morgoth's face, and he began to awaken. Beren and Lúthien\nfled in terror, but were not chased as Morgoth and his court had not yet\nwoke. However, at the gates of Angband the werewolf Carcharoth was aware\nof them, and later bit off Beren's hand, and took with it the Silmaril.\nBurning from the inside at the touch of the holy jewel, Carcharoth went\nmad and fled in wrath from Angband, slaughtering all who stood in his\npath. Then Morgoth awoke, and in a rage he and his court roared up in\npursuit, only to see Thorondor carrying off the raiders. Morgoth's rage\nat the loss of the Silmaril caused the Iron Mountains to begin erupting,\nterrifying all those who could see it. Ultimately however, he was unable\nto recover the gem.\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad\n\nSoon after, Morgoth became aware that Maedhros was making a great league\nagainst him, and driving his orcs off the northern heights. As such, he\ntook council against them and prepared his forces for a major\nconfrontation. When the elves eventually made it to Angband, the Battle\nof Nirnaeth Arnoediad began. Ultimately, the battle was a complete and\ndecisive victory for Morgoth. The power of the elves and their Edain\ncompatriots to make war against Morgoth was utterly and permanently\nbroken. All of the great kingdoms of the Noldor in Beleriand besides\nGondolin, were destroyed, and Hithlum was at last taken as well. The\nEdain who did not flee were enslaved by Easterlings, and Húrin was taken\ncaptive.\n\nThe Cursing of Húrin\n\nMorgoth was also well known for the imprisonment of Húrin of the House\nof Hador during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. In the last hours of the battle,\nHúrin and his kin defended Turgon, for he was the last heir to the\nthrones of Gondolin and Fingolfin after his brother Fingon fell in\nbattle. Turgon narrowly escaped the clutches of the host of orcs due to\nthe valor of Húrin, Huor, and their men.\n\nUnfortunately, all but Húrin fell after the onslaught of Morgoth's\nforces. After slaying untold numbers of trolls and orcs single-handedly,\nHúrin was captured by Gothmog and taken to Angband. Morgoth knew that\nHúrin had been to Gondolin, and therefore knew the city's location. He\nsought to extract the information from him but, despite inflicting\nterrible torment upon his captive, he was unsuccessful.\n\n\n\nFrom a distance Morgoth put the son and daughter of Húrin, Turin and\nNienor, under a species of _diabolic oppression_: his thought followed\nthem and gave them bad luck, though they were not possessed. By this\nmeans he drove them at last to madness and despair; though there is\ndoubt as to whether in the extremity of his malice he cheated himself,\nas their madness saved them from damnation.\n\nThen, continuing his curse, he said:\n\nAnd so Húrin stayed and was chained atop Thangorodrim, watching his\nhomelands fall under the shadow of Morgoth until he released him. Túrin,\nwho was valiant and powerful, nearly escaped the curse, as feared by\nMorgoth, but in the end did not. He and his sister Nienor Níniel\nperished. Thus, the curse of Morgoth on the Children of Húrin was\nfulfilled.\n\nFall of Gondolin\n\nIt was said that Morgoth hated and feared the House of Fingolfin the\nmost of the three Houses of the sons of Finwe, and he feared most\nFingolfin's son Turgon, as it was prophesised that from the House of\nTurgon would his doom come. Following Turgon's escape from the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, Morgoth sought to find and destroy the last of the free\nkingdoms of the Noldor; Gondolin, where Turgon resided.  Though he had been unable to\nforce Húrin to reveal the location of the last great elven kingdom,\nMorgoth eventually captured Maeglin, sister-son of Turgon, the King of\nGondolin. Threatened with unimaginable torment, Maeglin offered the\nsecrets of Gondolin's defenses in exchange for his own well-being.\nAdditionally, he made a promise to kill Tuor personally, and was given\npermission by Morgoth to take Idril for himself. Having lusted after\nIdril for decades, Morgoth's offer secured Maeglin's loyalty, and he\nbecame the Dark Lord's willing servant. After learning all he could from\nMaeglin, Morgoth sent him back to Gondolin to aid the invasion from\nwithin when the time came.\n\nSoon after, Morgoth assailed Gondolin, the last great realm of the\nÑoldor. With Maeglin's treacherous information, Morgoth's forces\nadvanced upon city nearly undetected, during a time of festival and over\nthe mountains where the watch was least vigilant. By the time the elves\nrealized their peril, the city had been beleaguered without hope by\nMorgoth's overwhelmingly superior forces, and quickly fell.\n\nWith the Sacking of Gondolin and the defeat of the Noldor and their\nallies, Morgoth's triumph was complete. The great kingdoms of the\nelves had all fallen, save for the Havens of Cirdan and the survivors at\nthe Mouths of Sirion, which were ruled by Eärendil, and Morgoth esteemed\nthem as nothing. He even came to care nothing for the Silmaril that had\nbeen taken from him, and laughed when he saw the last and the most cruel\nkinslaying when the Sons of Feanor destroyed the dwelling at Arvernien.\n\nFinal defeat\n\n\n\nHowever, Morgoth's triumph was relatively short lived. Persuaded by\nEärendil to take pity on the Elves and Edain, the Valar once again took\nup arms against Morgoth's tyranny. Unable to understand compassion,\nMorgoth did not expect that the Valar would ever help the Ñoldor after\nthe terrible sins they had committed, and did not foresee the assault\nfrom Aman. But the Valar mustered their forces, and a great battle began\nbetween Morgoth and the Host of Valinor. Morgoth emptied all of Angband,\nand his devices and engines and armies of slaves were so various and\npowerful that the fighting spilled across all Beleriand.\n\nIn the end, Morgoth's forces were utterly defeated. The Balrogs were\ndestroyed, save some few that fled and hid themselves in caverns at the\nvery roots of the earth, and the orcs were slaughtered. Then Morgoth\nquailed, and dared not come forth himself, but he had one last weapon at\nhis command: the monstrous Winged Dragons. From out of the pits of\nAngband they issued, and so sudden and ruinous was their attack, with\ngreat power and a tempest of fire, that they drove back the host of the\nValar. But then Eärendil came with Vingilot, accompanied by Thorondor\nand all the great birds, and Eärendil slew Ancalagon The Black, whose\ngreat bulk fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim, breaking them in his\nruin.\n\nMorgoth was utterly defeated and stood at bay, but was yet unvaliant. He\nfled into the deepest of his mines and sued for peace and pardon, but\nhis feet were hewn from under him, and he was cast upon his face. He was\nbound with the chain Angainor, his Iron Crown was beaten into a collar\nfor his neck, and he was thrust through the Door of Night into the\nTimeless Void. The two remaining Silmarils were recovered from him,\nthough shortly thereafter they were again lost.\n\nLegacy and Prophesied return\n\n\n\nMelkor's lies, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men, spawned a seed that\ndid not die and could not be destroyed, but ever and on sprouted anew,\nand bore dark fruit ever after. Sauron, his most powerful servant,\nremained loyal to his master's memory. After his first defeat during the\nSecond Age, Sauron was held prisoner in Numenor, but managed to corrupt\nthe king, Ar-Pharazôn, and several of his followers, into worshiping\nMelkor as a god.\n\nDagor Dagorath\n\nAccording to material in some of Tolkien's writings compiled (but not\npublished) by his son, in the last days Melkor will learn how to break\nthe Door of Night and re-enter the World, and initiate the Dagor\nDagorath, the Battle of Battles. In this battle Morgoth himself\nwould be slain by none other than Túrin Turambar, returned to life. Thus\nthe Children of Húrin and all Men will be avenged from this defeat.\n\nHowever, the published Silmarillion does not include this information,\nand instead asserts that, if the Valar know how the end of Arda will\npresent itself, they have not revealed it.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _MELKOR_ was a Quenya word that meant “One who arises in\nMight”; his name in Sindarin was BELEGÛR or BELEGURTH (“Great\nDeath”).\n\nOther names\n\nBefore his defeat in the War for Sake of the Elves, the fearful early\nelves of Cuiviénen called him the DARK HUNTER.\n\nThe name MORGOTH, which he was called by Fëanor at Valmar after Melkor\nstole the Silmarils, meant “Dark Enemy”, even though it was BLACK FOE OF\nTHE WORLD that Feanor named him out loud. It was also used by lore\nmasters and the Wise when discussing Melkor's latter state of being,\nwhen he became “ever more bound to the earth”, having dissipated his\npower, and becoming in consequence “the Morgoth.” He was also known as\nMELKOR BAUGLIR when he returned to Angband towards the beginning of the\nFirst Age. BAUGLIR meant “the Constrainer”.\n\nHis Old English name is MANFRÉA BOLGEN, from the Old English words _man_\n(“evil, wickedness”), _fréa_ (“lord”), and _bolgen_ (“wrathful”).\n\nTitles\n\nHe was the world's first Dark Lord. Melkor was also known for giving\nhimself titles and referred to himself as KING OF THE WORLD and the\nELDER KING. After his defeat, his most powerful servant Sauron\ncalled him LORD OF ALL AND GIVER OF FREEDOM and LORD OF THE DARK as a\nway of getting the corrupted Númenóreans to worship him.\n\nEarlier names\n\nIn both volumes of _The Book of Lost Tales,_ Tolkien called him MELKO,\nBELCHA (from the Quenya _velka_ “flame”) , ULBAN(D) (“monster”)\n'''Melegor ''', and MELEKO.\n\nMaterial in _The Lost Road and Other Writings_ refers to him as\n'''Melko, Alkar, '''and MARDELLO.\n\n\nPowers and abilities\n\nMelkor was one of the strongest of the creatures in _The Lord of the\nRings_, second only to Eru Iluvatar himself.\n\nEven while incredibly weakened he could create massive firestorms, huge\ncraters, and curse his foes to sorrow and death. He was far above any of\nthe Balrogs, such as Durin's Bane (Arguably the weakest Balrog, as he\nfled from the War of Wrath), could do considerable damage to a large\nmountain and create massive thunderstorms\n\nHe could telepathically pin Hurin, an incredibly hardy man, with ease,\neven at his weakest. He also gave Hurin the ability to see all that\nMelkor saw and granted him immortality.\n\nHe casually tanked energy from the Silmarils, which had the energy of\nthe Two Trees within them. This means they contain the energy of all the\nstars (As Teleperion's dew made the stars), 1/3 each.\n\nAt his prime he could spill enormous oceans and destroy mountain ranges,\nmountain ranges in world where mountains like Thangorodrim’s exist, with\nphysical might alone. He could also take on the 14 other Valar , each of\nwhich could shape countless stars at once.\n\nIt also appears that even his “prime” is simply a restricted for, as\nstated in the Anulindale. In the Anulindale he created the very concept\nof discord, and overpowered all of the at the very least thousands of\nother Ainur, who themselves could create universal concepts.",
