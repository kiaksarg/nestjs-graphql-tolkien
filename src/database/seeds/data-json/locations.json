Eru commanded that the Eä “be!”, “ be!”, and then it\nwas.\n\nThis act of creation recalls the biblical creation narrative, in which\nGod began creating the universe with the verbal command, “Let there be\nlight.” as well as the first line of the Gospel of John, “In the\nbeginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was\nGod.” Another parallel is the Hindu “Aum|Om”.

The camps on Balar maintained close contact with the refugee\ncamp in Arvernien headed by the half-elf, Eärendil. It was on Balar that\nCírdan helped Eärendil build the ship Vingilotë, with which later he\nsought for Valinor, to ask for the pardon of the Valar and help against\nMorgoth.\n\nDuring the War of Wrath, many Sindar and some Ñoldor were still camped\nat the Isle of Balar, and after the war, some survivors were gathered\nthere given the fact that they could not return to they homes in the\nBeleriand. From Balar many elves went to Lindon until the elves were\nsummoned to return to Valinor and the Edain to the newly raised isle of\nNúmenor. Sometime after SA 32, the Isle of Balar eventually fell beneath\nthe Belegaer becoming one the _Lands Under the Wave_.\n\nIt had also been a place where many pearls could be found off its\nshores.",

When the Ñoldor did return, the majority of the region was\nunder control of Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod\nand Amras, the Sons of Fëanor. They built extensive fortresses and\nCastles in the area between Lothlann and Thargelion which buttressed\nMorgoth's domain in the farther north. The dominant languages here\nduring this time was Sindarin and Quenya but later there were also\nmannish speeches as well.\n\nBy the later First Age, more and more of this land fell under the power\nof Morgoth until it was finally conquered by the Dark Powers and was\nrenamed Dor Daedeloth. It, along with the rest of Beleriand, was\ndestroyed after the War of Wrath.

After SA 1350, they crossed the Misty Mountains to\nLothlórien, their new kingdom.\n\nFrom SA 1350, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain under Celebrimbor, the last of the\nHouse of Fëanor left in Middle-earth, ruled Eregion. Annatar, the Giver\nof Gifts, befriended Celebrimbor and aiding him in the making of the\nNine and the Seven of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor made the Three in\nsecret, and as such these were never touched by Annatar's hands.\n\nWhen Annatar was later revealed to be the Dark Lord Sauron, Celebrimbor\nand his people tried to stop the Rings from entering Sauron's\npossession, but could only rescue the Three: Vilya, Narya, and Nenya.\nEregion itself was attacked and destroyed in the War of the Elves and\nSauron in the year SA 1697. The few survivors of the war found refuge in\neither Lindon or Lothlórien, while others led by Elrond founded\nRivendell.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn the Third Age, by the time that the Fellowship of the Ring reached\nKhazad-dûm, the land was pleasant but unpopulated. Only the scattered\nruins of Elven cities and the few remaining holly trees indicated its\nformer glory.\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, EREGION means “Land of the Holly”, deriving from _ereg_\n(“holly”).

It\nended at the door to the Chambers of Fire on the east side of Mount Doom\nfacing the Window of the Eye in Barad-dûr.

The earlier king was the first to fully\nembrace the necessity of a strong navy, and through its use extended the\ninfluence of Gondor around the Mouths of Anduin. On March 13 3019,\nshortly before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, some hundreds of\nfishermen went to aid Minas Tirith without a captain. Much later,\nAragorn vanquished a brief Umbarian invasion of the area. Aragorn, along\nwith Grey Company and the Army of the Dead, liberated Pelargir and the\nsurrounding Anduin estuary from the Corsairs of Umbar, after having\nprogressively pushed them out of the delta for much of that week.\nBecause the victory on 13 March was so complete, Umbar was left with no\ntools to effect its sovereignty. Thus, what might be thought of as the\n“Battle of Ethir Anduin” led directly to Umbar's reintegration with\nGondor in Aragorn's Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe land on the delta was long settled by Men, and indeed it was a rich\nsource of Mannish culture. Part of the reason for this was because it\nwas contested between different types of Men, probably including groups\nlike the Nandorians and Haradrim, but definitely including\nNúmenóreans, Gondorians and Umbarians. Early Westron was said to have\ndeveloped there. The reason for the region's importance to the\ndevelopment of Mannish language was likely because the lands of the\ndelta supported Men of all stations in life, from lowly “lesser men” who\nwere largely fishermen and other folk dependent on the sea, as well as\nthe loftier Numenoreans."

Its northern border was the Great\nEast Road, but Cardolan also claimed the Arthedain-controlled Weather\nHills, which contained the fortress of Weathertop and its valuable\nPalantír. For this reason the Weather Hills were claimed by all three\nkingdoms - Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. This territorial dispute\ncontinued until Rhudaur became a vassal of Angmar after the line of the\nDúnedain kings failed there.\n\nWhen the kingdom of Angmar arose in northern Eriador, Cardolan became\nthe most important ally of Arthedain. It had to fight the combined\narmies of both Angmar and Rhudaur. It soon became apparent that Cardolan\ncould not hold back the forces of Angmar and in its last years the\npeople became entrenched in the hill region, Tyrn Gorthad (the\nBarrowdowns). This position became untenable after Angmar sent evil\nspirits to inhabit the downs (the Barrow-wights). Arthedain could\nprovide little aid, as it was itself under attack. Around TA 1409\nCardolan was destroyed, and its former inhabitants accepted the King of\nArthedain as their lord. Arthedain managed to reconquer the land\nbriefly, but few people wished to live there on account of the\nBarrow-wights, and so Cardolan was never re-populated. \n\nAfter the final fall of Arnor, and the destruction of Angmar at the\nBattle of Fornost, Cardolan remained an unpopulated area until the\nreestablishment of the northern kingdom under King Aragorn II Elessar at\nthe end of the Third Age.

The area was\nvirtually treeless and somewhat bleak and was comparable to the adjacent\nBrown Lands to the east.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the distant past - perhaps up to the mid-Second Age, the Wold was\nonce well suited to the cultivation of crops and probably had many trees\n(judging by its name), but during the War of the Elves and Sauron,\nSauron invaded the rest of Middle-earth and left lands like the Wold in\nruins.\n\n\n\nMany important battles happened in the Wold:\n\n-   When Eorl the Young arrived in Calenardhon he destroyed a host of\n    orcs there.\n-   In the year TA 2545 Eorl the Young was killed in the Wold in a\n    battle against the Easterlings.\n\nSignificance in The Lord of the Rings\n\nIn The Two Towers, this is where Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas meet Éomer\nand are given the horses Arod and Hasufel. During the War of the Ring,\nan army of orcs from Dol Guldur unsuccessful in their invasion of Lórien\nwere surprised by an attack of Ents led by Treebeard in the Wold, and\nwere defeated.\n\n\nMiscellaneous Information\n\nThe name Wold likely derives from the Anglian Old English “wold” meaning\nforest or woodland (compare to the West Saxon “weald” and German “Wald,”\nfor example). Since the region was originally heavily forested but\nbecame bleak and treeless after Sauron ravaged it, a similarity may be\ndrawn between the Wold of Rohan and the Weald of Southeastern England.\nThis region was once covered by woodland; over centuries, however, local\nindustry, especially iron production, led to deforestation. The\netymological relation, as well as the historical similarity (especially\nwhen considering Sauron's fondness of destructive industrialization and\nTolkien's personal dislike of such), indicate that the name Wold is\nlikely an intentional play on words on Tolkien's part, similar perhaps\nto possibly intentional use of Atalantë (Atlantis) for Numenor.",

It was the first permanent settlement of the\nNúmenóreans in Middle-earth. From here Aldarion's “Guild of Venturers”\nbegan harvesting the local timber for the shipbuilding industry of\nNúmenor.\n\nWithin a few centuries, the deforestation of the outlying regions\nEnedwaith and Minhiriath became cataclysmic, angering the local native\npopulation (ancestors of the Dunlendings), and they began to fight back\nwith increasing ferocity, destroying the haven several times, and\nfrequently burning the great wood-stores in 'hit-and-run' attacks.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Elves and Sauron in the middle of the\nSecond Age, this 'New Haven' had become very well established, and its\nname had shifted over the intervening one thousand years to 'Lond Daer',\nthe Great Haven. As such, it was one of the two beachheads of the\nNúmenórean forces in Eriador that were used to support the elves around\nSA 1700.\n\nLond Daer's shipyards were starved of timber following the war, as the\nforces of Sauron had burnt almost all of what remained in Enedwaith and\nMinhiriath. Once its shipbuilding yards were no longer practicable, Lond\nDaer declined in importance, and the Númenórean hunger for ever more\nwealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south,\nPelargir and Umbar. Following this, Lond Daer was once again renamed,\nbeing now one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as\nLOND DAER ENEDH, or 'Great Middle Haven'. Despite this, Númenor still\nmaintained traffic on the Gwathló as far as the city of Tharbad.\n\nAfter the Downfall of Númenor, Elendil founded the realm of Arnor in the\nlands north of Lond Daer, but the haven was now redundant, and fell into\nruin. Instead, control over the region was maintained from Tharbad. The\nancient ruins of Lond Daer were still visible as late as the end of the\nThird Age, however, and still featured on maps from that time.",

It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep\ninto the northern glen of the vale. Its waters were dark: a deep blue\nlike clear evening sky and there was a smooth sward of grass around its\nrim.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the First Age, Durin the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves\nwandered into Azanulbizar vale and beheld in a small, still lake a\nreflection of himself bearing a crown of seven stars. The stars were the\nconstellation Durin's Crown which the elves call Valacirca and men call\nthe Big Bear. Because of this sign Durin chose to build his great hall\nMoria in the mountains above that vale. The name Kheled-zâram is in\nKhuzdul and means “Glass-lake”. In Westron it was called MIRRORMERE, it\nis probably so named because the waters of the lake were always smooth\nand the stars could always be seen reflected in its surface no matter\nthe time of day. Only Durin, however, could see his own reflection.\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin's Folk regarded this site as sacred and built a\nmonument there. It was a single stone column called Durin's Stone,\nstanding by the roadside. After Moria was abandoned it fell into\ndisrepair, and in the last years of the Third Age it was cracked,\nweather-worn, and broken at the top.\n\nWhen Balin came to retake Moria in TA 2989 one of his companions, a\ndwarf named Flói was slain in a battle before the Gates and was buried\nin a place of honour by the banks of Kheled-zâram.

Over time, the battlefield became\nmarshes, which swallowed up the dead, though their bodies could still be\nseen floating in the water (although, according to Gollum, they are not\nphysically there, and only appear as visions).\n\nDuring Gondor's war with the Wainriders, King Ondoher's army was caught\nby surprise and he and his men were driven into the Dead Marshes and\ndefeated. When Eärnil II became king, he avenged the earlier defeat at\nthe Battle of the Camp in TA 1944, and the Wainriders were defeated and\ndriven into the marshes where most perished.\n\nThe Dead Marshes were located north-west of the Morannon, and southeast\nof the Emyn Muil. Aragorn once captured Gollum here, on February 1, 3017\nand took him to Mirkwood.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n\n\nDuring the quest to destroy the One Ring, Gollum led Frodo Baggins and\nSamwise Gamgee on a passage through the marshes. They entered the Dead\nMarshes at Dawn on the 1st of March. The Passage was marked by lights\nthat danced about and candles which Gollum called “_candles of\ncorpses_”; it is likely that those who become entranced by these lights\nand attempt to touch the bodies drown in the water and go down to join\nthe dead. It seems that the bodies only appear in the water when the\nlights are lit. At the Mere of Dead Faces, Frodo became entranced by\nthese lights and tried to reach out and touch the faces of the dead at\nthe bottom of the marshes, though Sam broke him out of his trance.\nGollum told them that the dead could not be touched, suggesting that he\nhad once tried to eat them. While passing through the marshes, a Black\nRider on a Fell beast passed overhead, terrifying Gollum enough that he\nstarted to slip back into his old speech-habits, which he had somewhat\ngiven up after swearing to “serve the master of the Precious.” They\nexited the Marshes on the morning of March 2, 3019.\n\n\n",

It was there that the One\nRing was lost by Isildur and found again a long time later by Déagol the\nStoor.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe fields started near the mouth of the river Gladden, and went on\nbeyond where it joined the Great River, extending onto its eastern\nbanks. It was a region of many dark pools and islets, with beds of reeds\nand rushes and many wildflowers - a particularly common flower being the\nYellow Iris, which grew there in profusion.\n\nIn ancient times when the Silvan Elves were in the region, there was a\npool or lake at the intersection of the two rivers; however, over time\nthis receded, forming the marshes.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was in the Gladden Fields that Isildur and his sons were travelling\nto Rivendell when they were assailed by Orcs in TA 2. Isildur, in an\nattempt to escape, jumped into the river, using the Ring to keep hidden.\nHowever, the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam away, landing in\nthe riverbed, and Isildur was slain by the Orcs' arrows on the bank of a\nsmall islet.\n\nThe fields were later settled by Stoors around TA 1356. The Ring\nremained undiscovered.\n\nAround two and a half millenia after the ambush, in TA 2463, the Hobbit\nDéagol found the ring when he was fishing with his cousin Sméagol: an\nespecially large fish pulled him under the water and, spotting it\namongst the weeds, he took it to the bank. Ensnared by the Ring's power,\nthe two fought over it, and ultimately it went to Sméagol, who killed\nDéagol and later became the creature called Gollum.\n\nLater, around TA 2851, Saruman began searching the wetlands for the\nRing. He found the Elendilmir, the token of Royalty of the\nNorth-kingdom, which Isildur had been wearing at the time of the attack.\nAt the meeting of the White Council that year, Saruman overruled\nGandalf's suggestion that they purge Sauron from his stronghold in Dol\nGuldur.\n\nSauron also sent his servants to search for the Ring. When the White\nCouncil learned of this, they agreed to an attack on Dol Guldur to\nprevent Sauron from finding the Ring, in TA 2941. At the meeting of the\nWhite Council in TA 2953, Saruman pretended that he had learned that the\nRing had been carried downriver to the Sea.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nGladden Fields was Sindarin for LOEG NINGLORON.",

A path led\nfrom the north side of Weathertop northward to the other Weather Hills.\nThe elevation of Weathertop itself above sea level was likely in the\norder of 1500-2000 feet (around 450-600 meters)\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe strategic importance of Weathertop was recognised early, and during\nthe reign of Elendil the Dunedain of Arnor built a watchtower on its\nsummit, installing the most powerful of Arnor's three _Palantíri_ in the\ntower. This _Palantír_ further enhanced Weathertop's value, as it could\nbe used for intelligence gathering and rapid communication with the King\nin Annúminas, or later in Fornost. \n\n[Gil-Galad and Elendil meeting at Amon Sûl, by Abe Papakhian.]\n\nIn TA 861, Arnor was divided into the kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan\nand Rhudaur.

During this\ntime, Weathertop may have changed hands on several occasions. By the\nlatter part of the 14th century, Weathertop was controlled by Arthedain\nand Cardolan, which were at that time allied against Rhudaur and Angmar,\nand was the chief fortress in their fortified border with Rhudaur. The\nwatchtower and fortifications were burned and destroyed in TA 1409 by\nforces of the Witch-king.\n\nKing Arveleg I was slain while defending the watchtower, but the\nDúnedain of Arthedain saved the _Palantír_ and took it to their capital\nat Fornost.

With her\nsister realm, Nogrod, Belegost was dug deep beneath Mount Dolmed in the\nBlue Mountains in the Ages of Stars.\n\nAmongst the Dwarves of Belegost were the finest smiths and stone-carvers\nin Middle-earth. In their armourer's halls they made many bright weapons\nand were the first people to forge chain-mail. The Dwarves of Belegost\ntraded with the Sindar Elves of Beleriand and supplied them with weapons\nof incomparably tempered steel; furthermore these Dwarves carved the\nstone chambers of Menegroth. One of their payments for these services\nwas Nimphelos, a great pearl.\n\nIn the First Age, the Dwarves of Belegost and their lord, Azaghâl, won\ngreat fame in the War of the Jewels.

It was originally built in the Second Age\nand leveled after Sauron's defeat in the War of the Last Alliance.\nSauron had Barad-dûr rebuilt during the Third Age as he regained his\npower, but the tower was forever destroyed immediately following the\ndestruction of the One Ring, as it was constructed and held together\nusing the Ring's dark magic.\n\n\nHistory\n\n[The Gates of Barad-dûr, and rivers of molten rock from Mount Doom]\n\nBarad-dûr was built by Sauron in the land of Mordor, not far from the\nvolcano known as Mount Doom. The construction of the tower began around\nthe SA 1000, and took six hundred years to complete. It was the greatest\nfortress built since the fall of Angband during the War of Wrath.\n\nBarad-dûr fell under siege for seven years by the Last Alliance of Elves\nand Men during the Second Age, and was leveled after Sauron's defeat at\nthe hands of Isildur, but because it was created using the power of the\nOne Ring, its foundations could not be destroyed completely while the\nRing itself still existed. As Isildur failed to destroy the Ring, the\ntower was eventually re-built when Sauron returned to Mordor thousands\nof years later.\n\nSome time near the end of the Third Age (TA 3009-TA 3017), Gollum was\ncaptured and taken to Barad-dûr, while Gandalf and Aragorn were also\nsearching for him. He was tortured for information regarding the\nwhereabouts of the One Ring, as Sauron had learned that he had once\npossessed it, and thus Sauron learned that the One Ring had been found.\nSatisfied that he had learned all he could from the creature, Sauron\nallowed Gollum to be released in TA 3017.\n\n[The eye of Sauron upon Barad-dûr]\n\nOnly when Frodo Baggins (with the unwitting aid of Gollum) destroyed the\nOne Ring, the Tower was finally brought down.

Along the\nnorthern shore of the Ascar ran the Dwarf-Road to Nogrod. The region was\nwarm and gentle, with coniferous woodlands.\n\nSeven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and these are (from north\nto south):\n\n1.  River _Gelion_\n2.  River _Ascar_ or _Rathlóriel_\n3.  River _Thalos_\n4.  River _Legolin_\n5.  River _Brilthor_\n6.  River _Duilwen_\n7.  River _Adurant_\n\n\nHistory\n\nOssiriand was a green and forested land, and it was not populated by the\nSindar. In the early First Age before the rise of the Moon, a part of\nthe Telerin elven people called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their\nleader King Denethor, and were given permission by Thingol to settle the\nlands.\n\nAfter them the land was often renamed Lindon, for _The Singers_, after\nthe old clan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their\ntongue. They became known as the Laiquendi, or Green-Elves.\n\nThe Elves of Ossiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of\nBeleriand. After their leader Denethor was killed in an orc-raid they\nchose no more leaders, and many of them moved to Doriath.\n\nAfter the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Lúthien lived their second\nlives in Dor Firn-i-Guinar on Tol Galen.

The land was known in part for\nits cold and snowy weather.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLong before the Witch-king came to Angmar, the dwarves had many\nflourishing mines in the region, and halls that were secure and\nprosperous. It was not long before Durin's Folk felt the first assaults\nof Angmar. They fled southward, seeking the safety of their mines in the\nWeather Hills. \n\nThe Witch-king arose in Angmar during the realm of Malvegil of\nArthedain, at some time between TA 1272 and TA 1349. Men became aware of\nthe growing evil in the mountains, but Angmar was still preparing its\npower. No assaults on the Dunedain came until Argeleb I, the son of\nMalvegil, assumed the throne of Arthedain. \n\nIn TA 1356, the sub-realm Rhudaur was forced to invade Arthedain; many\nwere slaughtered including their king, Argeleb I. However, with the help\nof Cardolan's armies, Arthedain maintained a strong line of defense at\nthe foot of the Weather Hills. \n\n\n\nThen in TA 1409, Angmar attacked Cardolan and Rivendell and destroyed\nall the settlements within except Cardolan's capital, the Barrow-downs.\nAmon Sul was razed and burned and the Dunedain were forced to flee\nwestward. Arthedain was now left without any allies to aid it, and so\nbegan a mighty struggle lasting another 500 years.  \n\nHelp came from the Elves of the Grey Havens, Rivendell, and Lorien. The\narmies of Angmar were repelled from Fornost and the North Downs, and\nforced to withdraw to Angmar. The shadow of the North was contained for\na time.  \n\nAfter the Great Plague, which started from the east of Mordor in TA\n1636, the last of Cardolan's people died, allowing Barrow-wights to be\nsent from Angmar into the downs. \n\nDuring the time of TA 1974, Angmar multiplied its forces and launched a\nfinal assault on Arthedain. Subsequently, they took its capital Fornost,\nthereby defeating the last northern kingdom of the Dunedain.\n\nSometime later, Prince Eärnur - thirty-third and last King of Gondor -\narrived to aid Arthedain, but he found he was too late.

The most important town of Buckland is\n_BUCKLEBURY_ where Brandy Hall is located, home of the Master of\nBuckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandwine river from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nnorth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo Baggins, Sam\nGamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took crossed using the Ferry\njust before the arrival of a Black Rider, who was forced to go around to\nthe Brandywine Bridge as there were no boats kept on the western bank of\nthe river. \n\n\nHistory\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 (SR 740) by Gorhendad Oldbuck, the\nancestor of Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first\nMaster of Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his\nfamily's name.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Brandywine, it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland, now renamed the EASTMARCH, and the Westmarch\nofficial parts of the Shire.\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats.",

Melkor built\nand delved many subterranean halls and dungeons of obsidian, fire and\nice beneath it .\n\n\nHistory\n\nWhen the world was young and Arda was bathed in the light of the two\nlamps Illuin and Ormal, Melkor first dug the great Pits of Utumno deep\nbeneath the mountains of the North. The fortress was constructed in the\nNorth in the Iron Mountains over one thousand miles from the later\nlocation of Angband, where the light of the lamps was almost\nnonexistent.\n\nHere were gathered all the evil powers of the World under the Lord of\nDarkness. Their numbers were vast, and Melkor had twisted many beautiful\nthings into horrifying and dreadful forms. Many of the great evils of\nthe world were bred in this place, such as trolls, “made in mockery of\nthe ents” as stated by Treebeard. It is probable that the Orcs were\nfirst bred here also, by the mutilating and corruption of lost Elves.\nCruel spirits, phantoms, wraiths, and evil demons stalked the halls of\nUtumno and haunted the surrounding forests. All were under the command\nof Melkor and his fallen Maiar servants; Gothmog the Lord of the Balrogs\nand Sauron the Sorcerer.\n\nFrom Utumno, Melkor poisoned and interfered with all the Valar's work\ndone during the Spring of Arda. Soon afterwards, Melkor and his servants\nwaged his war against the lamps of the Valar and struck them down,\nruining the world, and forcing the Valar to move further west to the\ncontinent of Aman.\n\nUtumno endured for many more millennia well into the early years of the\nElves at Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees when Middle-earth lay\nin the light of stars. Taking advantage of the new arrivals, Melkor\ncaptured some of them and thus, the hideous race of orcs was bred.\nKnowing that Melkor would continue to be a blight upon the world, the\nValar decided to protect the elves by ending his power in the north.\nAmidst the sounding of the trumpets, the Valar came out of the west, and\nafter the Battle of the Powers Utumno was besieged and destroyed in VY\n1099 , and Melkor was chained for about three thousand years.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_UTUMNO_ was the Quenya word for “Underworld”, also known as UDÛN\n(Sindarin for 'Hell').\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nEarlier texts referred to Utumno as the FORTRESS OF THE NORTH or\n_UTUMNA_.\n\nAlso, its location had once been north of the Iron Mountains rather than\nwithin them.",

Angband was also delved into these mountains\nwest of Utumno. After Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps, the Iron\nMountains were connected to the Blue Mountains of the West to the\nOrocarni of the east. Much later when the Valar decided to protect\nthe Elves from Melkor by defeating him and imprisoning him, the changing\nof the shape of Middle-earth effected the Iron Mountains as well.\nAfterwards, the mountain range was distorted but was still long with\nlengths stretching from the Helcaraxë in the far northwest to the\nOrocarni in the far east and rising to immense and frighting heights,\nwith enormous peaks such as Thangorodrim.\n\nIn the days of the War of the Jewels, the mountains protected Morgoth\nfrom being outflanked from the rear and with no enemy behind him, he was\nable to concentrate on the south. Because of its perilous heights,\nfrightening looks, and foul winds, no Elf ever passed through the\nmountains for any reason but the spies of Morgoth would always find ways\ninto the Beleriand, by unknown ways through the mountains. Morgoth's\nforces also captured Elves and brought them through the mountains to\nAngband.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath the Iron Mountains and Thangorodrim were\ndestroyed and the vast mountain chain was broken and disappeared for a\ngreat part of their length. North of the range lay the Forodwaith, a\nregion of ever-lasting cold. Remnants of the great mountain range in the\nThird Age included the Mountains of Angmar in northern Eriador, as well\nas the Ered Mithrin and the Iron Hills of northern Rhovanion.

It was an\neastern bay of the Inland Sea of Helcar, formed by the meltwaters of the\npillar of Illuin.\n\nAfter the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sea of Helcar (and\nCuiviénen with it) was drained, leaving behind only the Sea of Núrnen\nand the Sea of Rhûn, prompting the Elvish adage “and to Cuiviénen there\nis no returning”; both a reference to physical geography and a metaphor\nfor the Sundering. While never confirmed, there is a small chance that\nit survives in a much truncated form.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn YT 1050, the Awakening of the Elves took place. The Elves dwelt\nhere for a long time in bliss under the starlight and were content.\nHere the elves were divided into their three basic groups: the Minyar\n(Vanyar), Tatyar (Ñoldor), and Nelyar (Teleri), here they learned and\ndeveloped the basic skills of survival, culture, and language.\n\nUnfortunately, Melkor discovered this land first before the other Valar.\nMany elves feared him and they were forced to hide, and those\nunfortunate enough to be left behind or overwhelmed by fear and\nunhappiness were taken or slain. Then, years later, Oromë discovered\nCuiviénen on his travels throughout Middle-earth. Oromé reported his\ndiscovery back to the Valar in Valinor and after some debate they\ndecided that the Elves would be safer living in The Undying Lands, in\nthe peace and protection of the Valar. Oromé returned to Cuiviénen and\nthere spoke with the Elves regarding their removal to Valinor. The first\nSundering of the Elves then took place when the Eldar, name that was\ngiven by Oromé to the Elves using their own tongue, departed from\nCuiviénen to Valinor. Some of these Elves refused to leave through fear\nof the unknown, turned back after reaching the huge range of The Misty\nMountains, or simply decided to stay in Arda through choice.\n\nIt is unknown how long the remaining Avari remained at Cuiviénen during\nthe First Age, but they were there when Men awoke at the first rising of\nthe Sun in the nearby land of Hildórien, and its elven residents\nbefriended early Men and apparently taught them the basic skills of\nsurvival.\n\nOther mentions\n\nIn his attempt to sway the Ñoldor to join him in pursuit of Melkor to\nMiddle-earth, Fëanor spoke of the “sweet waters” of Cuiviénen that they\nhad left in vain to travel to Aman.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nCUIVIÉNEN is a Quenya word that means “Water of Awakening” from\n_cuivié_ (“awakening”) and _nen_ (“water”).",

Minhiriath had no clear\nborder in the north, but to the south, and east and west it was bounded\nby river and sea: the Brandywine, the Greyflood and the Belegaer, 'The\nGreat Sea'.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe original inhabitants of Minhiriath (Minhiriathrim) were descended\nfrom the same Men as the ancestors of the Numenoreans, but because they\nspoke mutually unintelligible languages, the Numenoreans did not class\nthe Minhiriathrim as Middle Men.\n\nWhen the large-scale deforestation of their land began under the\nNúmenórean 'Ship Kings' after the 7th century Second Age, the\nMinhiriathrim became openly hostile, and were persecuted. Only those who\n“fled from Minhiriath into the dark woods of the great Cape of Eryn\nVorn” survived. Most, if not all of these forest-dwellers subsequently\n“welcomed Sauron and hoped for his victory over the Men of the Sea”, but\nthey were to be disappointed - and permanently trapped - by Sauron's\nburning of much of the rest of the surviving forest, and final defeat,\nin SA 1701.\n\nFrom SA 3320, Minhiriath became nominally part of the newly established\nKingdom of Arnor, at which time it formed the upper part of _..a land\nthat was far and wide, on either bank a desert, treeless but untilled._\n\n('The History of Galadriel and Celeborn' from Unfinished Tales)\n\nFrom TA 861, Minhiriath was inherited by one of Arnor's three successor\nstates, Cardolan, but the “ravaging” of Cardolan by the evil forces of\nthe Witch-king of Angmar in TA 1409 no doubt caused extensive\ndepopulation of the whole country. Even worse was the advent of the\nGreat Plague in TA 1636, after which Minhiriath was “almost entirely\ndeserted”. After TA 1975, even though “a few secretive hunter-folk lived\nin the woods” throughout the Third Age (probably a reference which\nincludes Eryn Vorn), Minhiriath was claimed by no kingdom at all.\n\nAlthough “still in places well-wooded” by the time of the War of the\nRing, the once continuously forested Minhiriath bore the permanent scars\nof over 5000 years of felling, burning, and war.\n\nThe same is not necessarily the case for its human population, however,\nwhen talking of Eriador (and particularly the lands south and west of\nBree) to an innkeeper at the end of the War of the Ring. For example,\nGandalf confidently predicts that _..the waste in time will be waste no\nlonger, and there will be people and fields where once there was\nwilderness._\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Minhiriath_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Between Rivers' and thus an\nElvish form of _Mesopotamia_).",

They were made by men in the ancient days of the Northern Kingdom.\nMany of the hills were crowned with monoliths and barrows, whence comes\ntheir name. They served as resting places for the men of the north, as\nwell as the Dunedain, until evil spirits called Barrow-wights, sent by\nthe Witch-king of Angmar, began to inhabit them. During the Third Age,\nthe hills lay within the bounds of Cardolan in the region of Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nThe Barrow-downs were first inhabited by Men related to the Edain in the\nFirst Age, together with men from the Hills of Evendim to the north.\nThey fled as Eriador was invaded by Easterlings, but when they\ndisappeared after the War of Wrath the Edain returned to the region.\n\nDuring the Second Age, these people were fairly numerous, and when they\nmet with the Númenóreans the Barrow-downs were the first places where\nthe Dúnedain émigrés from Númenor settled. When Elendil returned to\nMiddle-earth, the Barrow-downs were incorporated into the kingdom of\nArnor.\n\nAfter the breaking of Arnor, the area of the Barrow-downs became the\ncapital of Cardolan. After Rhudaur fell to Angmar, the Dúnedain of\nCardolan entrenched themselves here, but eventually the realm fell.\nAfter the collapse of Cardolan and the flight of the remaining Dúnedain,\nthe area was left empty. To ensure that this place would remain\nuninhabited by his enemies, the Witch-king of Angmar sent evil spirits,\nknown as Barrow-wights, to haunt the once-great tombs of the ancient\nmen. After Arthedain claimed kingship over all of Arnor, there was an\nattempt by the Dúnedain to recolonize Cardolan once again; this\nultimately failed due to the mysterious power of the barrow-wights.\n\n\n\nFleeing the Black Riders, Frodo and his fellow Hobbits were ensnared by\na wight in one of the numerous barrows. The four were separated from one\nanother in a dense fog, and, all captured, ended up in the same barrow.\nThree of the Hobbits seemed under a spell, but Frodo, almost succumbing\nto the wight, was able to call out to Tom Bombadil. Tom, hearing his\nsong, came with haste to the barrow and dispelled the evil spirit from\nthe tomb. Tom Bombadil, whose house dwells in the Old Forest near to the\nBarrow-downs, had told them earlier to pass by barrows on the western\nside; the hobbits stopped for lunch on what must have been a barrow, and\npromptly fell asleep in the shade on the east side.

They\nwere raised by Morgoth, who delved his fortress of Angband beneath them\nand far back into the Iron Mountains. They were the highest peaks in all\nof Middle Earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThangorodrim was made up of three volcanoes of which were said to have\nbeen crafted by Morgoth from the slag and debris of the re-delving of\nAngband during the First Age. The mountains themselves were of little\nconsequence during Morgoth's rule of Angband, save to occasionally spew\nforth fire and magma when Morgoth was either exceptionally wrathful or\non the warpath.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Maedhros was taken prisoner and nailed to\na cliff of Thangorodrim as a method of torture. He was rescued by his\ncousin Fingon with the help of Thorondor, King of the Eagles. After\nhis family was cursed by Morgoth, Húrin was imprisoned in a chair on a\nhigh terrace to watch the curse unfold.\n\nFor a time immediately after the creation of Thangorodrim, the Great\nEagles made their eyries on the three mountains at the command of\nManwë in order to bring him news of Morgoth's doings. However, at some\ntime during the First Age the Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim near\nGondolin.\n\nAt the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great Gate of\nAngband, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and\nforts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the\nsides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could issue\nforth and surprise their foes.\n\nThangorodrim was destroyed during the War of Wrath at the end of the\nFirst Age when Ancalagon, freshly slain by Eärendil fell dead on the\npeaks and crushed them to rubble.\n\n\nSize and Height\n\nThe exact size and height of Thangorodrim are unclear, though they were\nsaid to have been the tallest mountains in Middle-earth. One drawing by\nTolkien illustrated in Karen Wynn Fonstad's _The Atlas of Middle-earth_,\nif drawn to scale, would have made each mountain 35,000 ft high and five\nmiles across, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 Númenórean\nmiles) north of Menegroth puts it too far away for some of the action in\n_The Silmarillion_ to make sense; a distance of 150-200 miles would have\nbeen more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien\nwas not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf\nruns': the plateau of Dorthonion forced a long detour, which added the\nextra 200, 250 miles to the distance.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_THANGORODRIM_ was a Sindarin word that tied together the roots\n'oppression', 'mountain', and 'group'; together meaning roughly\n'Oppressive peaks'.",

It ran between Minas Tirith and the Fords\nof Isen in the Gap of Rohan, where it joined the North-South Road to\nArnor. The Great West Road was approximately 425 miles long.\n\nAt its far eastern end, the Great West Road met the North-way which came\nfrom Minas Tirith through Forannest, the North-gate of the Rammas Echor.\nThe Great West Road then curved around Amon Dîn and ran westward through\nAnorien. The Road skirted the edge of the Drúadan Forest and passed the\nBeacon-hills of Gondor at the foot of the White Mountains.\n\nThe Great West Road ran through the edge of the Firien wood to avoid the\nmarshy land north of the forest. A path marked by a standing stone\nbranched southward off the Road to Halifirien, the last of the\nBeacon-hills. At the western edge of the Firien Wood, the Great West\nRoad crossed a bridge over the Mering Stream, which was the border\nbetween Gondor and Rohan.\n\nIn Rohan, the Great West Road passed through the Fenmarch and the\nregions of the Eastfold and the Folde. The Road traversed the Snowbourn\nby way of a ford near Edoras, and a track branched off to the city.\nFurther on, the Deeping-road branched off into the Deeping Coomb where\nHelm's Deep was located.\n\nThe Great West Road then curved northwestward for a ways. About two\nmiles before the Fords of Isen there was a sharp westward turn and the\nRoad ran straight down to the riverbank. On the other side of the Isen,\nthe North-South Road began. A branch road led north to Isengard.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, the Great West Road and the North-South\nRoad formed a single Royal Road between the two Kingdoms of the\nDunedain. At that time, the region between the Mering Stream and the\nFords of Isen was a province of Gondor called Calenardhon. In TA 2510,\nthat land became Rohan and the Rohirrim were responsible for maintaining\nthe stretch of the Great West Road that ran through their land.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, an army from Mordor crossed the Anduin into\nAnorien and blocked the Great West Road.

It shared a long border\nwith Cardolan along the Great East Road, and with Arthedain along the\nline of the Weather Hills.\n\nThe land between the rivers Hoarwell and Loudwater was also considered\npart of Rhudaur. It was called _the Angle_, and it is here that the\nfirst Stoor Hobbits came into Eriador around TA 1150. However, due to\nthe increasing hostility of Angmar these Stoors fled the region around\nTA 1356, with some of them moving west to the Shire, and others moving\nback to Wilderland.\n\n\n\nFrom the start of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two\nother successor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with\nArthedain over the Tower of Amon Sûl and the Palantír associated with\nthe tower.\n\n\n\nThe last Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were\ndescended of Men in service of Angmar. Under their rule the land became\na vassal of Angmar, and thus enemies of Cardolan and Arthedain.\n\nAngmar annexed and terminated the kingdom in TA 1409. By this time, the\nDúnedain were gone from the region, as well as most of the other\ninhabitants.\n\nThere is evidence that after the fall of Angmar at the Battle of Fornost\nthe Angle became home to the remainder of the Dunedain, and the Rangers\nof the North established several villages there, where their people\nlived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under King Aragorn\nII Elessar at the end of the Third Age.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Haeranedain_ (S.“Far Wandering Edain”) were Rhudaurians of\nNúmenorean descent, most were actually mix-blooded Tergil.

The\nrange lay mostly East-West, but also had a northern section, which was\nseparated from the main line of the Misty Mountains by the Gap of Rohan.\nEven at the southern latitude of Gondor and Rohan, the White Mountains\nbore snow even in summer, suggesting they were extremely high.

The White Mountains\nformed the northern boundary of Gondor and the southern boundary of\nRohan except in their easternmost provinces, where Gondor's province of\nAnorien lay to the north of the mountains.\n\nBecause of their always bearing snow at their highest peaks, the White\nMountains must have been at least 4800 meters (16'000 feet) above sea\nlevel, with occasional peaks probably in excess of 5500 meters. They\nwere, however, not as high as the Misty Mountains.\n\nIts notable peaks included _Irensaga_ “Iron Saw” and _Starkhorn_.\nBetween these two lay the _Dwimorberg_, entrance to the Paths of the\nDead.\n\nAt the eastern end, the city of Minas Tirith was carved into\n_Mindolluin_ mountain. The Warning beacons of Gondor were placed on top\nof seven peaks in the range: _Amon Dîn_, _Eilenach_, _Nardol_, _Erelas_,\n_Min-Rimmon_, _Calenhad_ and _Halifirien_.\n\nSeveral rivers raised in the White Mountains, among them: the Adorn (a\ntributary of Isen), and the Snowbourn and Mering Stream (tributaries of\nthe Entwash); and, on the south side, the Erui (a tributary of Anduin),\nthe Ringló and its tributary Ciril (which together with the Morthond all\nentered the Bay of Belfalas at Edhellond near Dol Amroth), the Lefnui of\nthe Anfalas, and the Five Rivers of Lebennin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe natives to the White Mountains were Drúedain who inhabited this\nregion in the Second Age. The only remnants of the Druedain's presence\nin this mountain range were their statues called the _Púkel-men_.\nSometime thereafter, evil men related to the Dunlendings drove the\nDrúedain out. Some of these men swore allegiance to Isildur, but\nbetrayed him and were cursed into the Army of the Dead. Aragorn,\nLegolas, and Gimli followed the Paths of the Dead in year 3019 of the\nThird Age and convinced the army to fight for Gondor in the War of the\nRing. After they did so, Aragorn released the Army of the Dead, for they\nhad fulfilled their oath. After and perhaps before the War of the Ring\nDwarves settled in the White Mountain, where they could have better\ncontact with their allies.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERED NIMRAIS_ is a Sindarin name: _Ered_ ('Mountains') and _Nimrais_\n('White peaks')",

    "text": "The KINGDOM OF RHOVANION was a realm of Men in the Middle-earth region\nof Rhovanion that is rarely given specifications in Tolkien's books.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe kingdom of Rhovanion was founded by the northmen and stretched from\nMirkwood, in the west, to Dorwinion, in the east. It had strong ties\nwith the kingdom of Gondor and fought side by side in its wars against\nthe Easterlings of Rhûn.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early Third Age, a group of Northmen who were led by a 'Prince of\nRhovanion' who founded the Kingdom of Rhovanion sometime before the year\nTA 490. Rhovanion at this time referred only to the region where he and\nhis people dwelt, a strip of land east of Greenwood the Great and south\nof Dale and Lake-town. It is possible that Dale and Lake-town formed\npart of the Kingdom before the Dwarven Kingdom in the Lonely Mountain\nwas founded by the Dwarves of Durin's Folk.\n\nThe Men of Rhovanion fought with Gondor against the Easterlings of Rhûn,\nwho threatened their lands, and when these were defeated by King\nTurambar of Gondor in TA 550, Rhovanion became an ally of Gondor. By TA\n1200 the ruler of Rhovanion called himself the King of Rhovanion. In TA\n1248 Rómendacil II of Gondor destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even\nbeyond the Sea of Rhûn, and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged.\nGondor withdrew its borders to the Anduin, and ceded all the lands east\nof Anduin to Rhovanion. From this time onward, the name Rhovanion\nreferred to all of Wilderland.\n\nThe King of Rhovanion at this time was Vidugavia, and Prince Valacar of\nGondor served in his army. Vidugavia's daughter Vidumavi married\nValacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar of Gondor in TA\n1432, which led to the Kin-strife in TA 1437. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion,\nand with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in TA 1447.\n\nIn TA 1636 the Great Plague devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half\nits people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in TA 1851 the Wainriders\noverran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but\nin TA 1899 Rhovanion rebelled, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from\nthe west. Rhovanion was freed, but left extremely weakened. Many Men of\nRhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant\nrelatives. Some of them may have gone north to Dale and Lake-town after\nTA 1999, when the Kingdom under the Mountain was founded.\n\nIn TA 2460 Sauron returned to Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, although\nthis was not learned until long after. The land gradually became more\ndangerous, and Rhovanion was emptied of most its people. Around TA 2510\na new group of Easterlings, the Balchoth, appeared, and they quickly\ntook the old lands of Rhovanion. This was the final end of the Kingdom\nof Rhovanion after over two thousand years of independence.",

The Withywindle, as told in Hobbit folklore,\nwas the center of queerness in the vast queerness of the forest. At the\nsouth-eastern edge of the forest, on the bank of the river Withywindle,\nstood the house of Tom Bombadil - the only constructed dwelling in the\nforest. The home of Bombadil rested in a glade near the Withywindle--a\nsunny spot with green grass and bright trees. The pathway through the\nOld Forest known by the Hobbits was near the bonfire grove, although\nwhen the company arrived there, it appeared to have shifted.\n\nThe southern edge of the forest consisted primarily of oak and ash,\nbeing much more dense than the pine and fir-filled north.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Third Age\n\n[_Old Forest Road_, by Ben Zweifel. ©Fantasy Flight Games and\n©Middle-earth Enterprises]\n\nThe Old Forest, along with Fangorn Forest, was all that remained of a\nvast and ancient primordial forest that once spanned nearly all of\nEriador before the Second Age, and is one of the few forests that the\nElves decided to wake and teach to speak. Beginning in the middle of the\nSecond Age, the forest came under threat by the felling of trees by the\nMen of Middle-earth and of Númenor. Later, when Sauron declared war on\nthe Elves, the havoc and destruction he and his troops created resulted\nin the near destruction of Eriador and the burning of much of the\nforest.\n\nThird Age\n\nBy the Third Age, the forest had become wild and dangerous and those\nthat lived near it had to take precautions, particularly the\nBucklanders, who built the High Hay to keep out wild creatures. Before\nthe War of the Ring, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin passed through the\nOld Forest on their way to Bree and were rescued by Tom Bombadil, after\nbeing trapped by Old Man Willow.\n\n\nLore\n\nThe Hobbits believed the trees of the Old Forest were in some manner\n“awake”. They sway when there is no wind, whisper at night, and mislead\nand waylay travelers. In a notable incident, trees from the Old Forest\nmoved right next to the protective hedge; the Hobbits in turn cut down\nand burned them in an enormous bonfire. Ever since then, the trees were\nmore hostile --the Huorns. In any event, despite being an ancient and\n“awake” forest, no Ents tend to this woodland, and it seems to be\navoided by Elves as well.",

Tolkien's original name for this city - until the final\ndevelopment of his many tales of the First Age, as accounted in ''The\nHistory of Middle-earth - ''was KÔR.\n\nHistory\n\nThe green hill of Túna was located in the steep-walled valley of\nCalacirya (translated from Quenya as “The Cleft of Light”), the only\npass through the mountains of the Pelóri. Upon the crown of the hill the\nelves raised their largest settlement west of the sea. The walls and\nterraces were white, and the sand in the streets was said to be of\ngrains of diamond, and white crystal stairs climbed from the fertile\nland beneath to the great gates.\n\nThe center of the city was dominated by Ingwë's tower, “Mindon\nEldaliéva”, whose silver lantern shone far out to sea. Beneath the tower\nwas the house of Finwë, first High King of the Ñoldor. Here also was the\nGreat Square, where the white tree Galathilion flourished, and later the\nsite of Fëanor's infamous oath.\n\nAfter most of the Vanyar elves resettled in Valinor, the rule of Tirion\nwas given to Finwë. Many years of bliss followed, until Tirion was\nshaken by the king's eldest son, Fëanor. After the murder of his father\nat the hands of the Dark Lord Morgoth and the theft of his most precious\ngems, the Silmarils, Fëanor assembled the Noldor at the Great Square,\nwhere he urged the elves to leave with him back to Middle-earth to\navenge their king and reclaim the Silmarils, and to see that their lives\nin Tirion were simply a prison brought upon them by the Valar. In the\nend only a tenth of the population remained when Fëanor, his brothers\nand his and their children departed, though some followed their new king\nonly reluctantly, and some would soon after follow Finarfin back to\nTirion.\n\nNearly 600 years passed before Tirion once again appeared in the\nmythology. When all the kingdoms of the elves in Middle-earth were in\nruins, the half-elven Eärendil (father of the famous Elrond) sailed into\nthe west in search of Valinor to ask for the assistance of the Valar in\nthe war against Morgoth. Eärendil arrived in Tirion on a day of festival\nin Valinor when the city was all but empty, and only when he had turned\nhis back on the city and began to return a herald of the Valar\napproached him.\n\nMore than 3,000 years followed before Tirion was for the first time seen\nby mortal eyes by the soldiers of twenty-fifth and last King of Númenor,\ndeceived by Sauron, landed in on the shores of Eldamar and camped around\nTúna, which the fleeing elves emptied. When the Men of Númenor were\nburied under falling hills, Tirion, along with all the Undying Lands,\nwas taken out of mortal reach forever.\n\nEtymology\n\n_Tirion_ was a Quenyan word that meant 'Watch-tower'.",

    "text": "AMAN (Quenya; IPA: ; “blessed realm”) was a continent that lay west of\nMiddle-earth, across the great ocean Belegaer. It was the home of the\nValar, and three kindreds of Elves: the Vanyar, some of the Ñoldor, and\nsome of the Teleri. The island of Tol Eressëa lay just off the eastern\nshore.\n\n\nHistory\n\nUpon the destruction of Almaren in very ancient times of Arda, the Valar\nfled to the great continent of Aman in the far west of Arda, and there\nestablished the realm of Valinor. Seeking to isolate themselves, they\nraised a great mountain fence, called the Pelóri, on the eastern coast,\nand set the Enchanted Isles in the ocean to prevent travellers by sea\nfrom reaching Aman.\n\nFor reasons unknown, the Valar left two lands outside the wall of the\nPelóri: Araman to the northeast and Avathar to the southeast. Ungoliant,\na great spider of unknown origin, had managed to escape notice in\nAvathar. When Melkor was released from his captivity, he fled to\nAvathar, scaled the mountains with Ungoliant's help, and wrought\ndestruction of great consequence in Aman.\n\nThe first navigator to succeed in passing the Isles of Enchantment was\nEärendil, who came to Valinor to seek the aid of the Valar against\nMelkor, now called _Morgoth_. His quest was successful, the Valar went\nto war again, and also decided to remove the Isles.\n\nSoon after this, the great island of Númenor was raised out of Belegaer,\nclose to the shores of Aman, and the Three Houses of the Edain were\nbrought to live there. Henceforth, they were called the Dunedain, or\n_Men of the West_, and were blessed with many gifts by the Valar and the\nElves of Tol Eressëa. The Valar feared— rightly— that the Numenoreans\nwould seek to enter Aman to gain immortality (even though a mortal in\nAman remains mortal), so they forbade them from sailing west of the\nwesternmost promontory of Númenor. In time, and not without some\ncorrupting help from Sauron, the Numenoreans violated the Ban of the\nValar, and sailed to Aman with a great army under the command of\nAr-Pharazôn the Golden. The Valar collapsed a part of the Pelóri on this\narmy, trapping it but not killing it. It is said that the army still\nlies beneath the pile of rock.\n\nIn light of this new development, the Valar decided to again isolate\nthemselves from the other lands, but by a more decisive method than\nenchanted islands. The earth, at this time, was flat. They called upon\nEru Ilúvatar, and he clove it in two, making Middle-earth round and\nremoving Aman from Arda, so that a mariner sailing west along Eärendil's\nroute would simply emerge in the far east. For the elves, however, they\ncrafted a Straight Road that peels away from the curvature of the earth\nand passes to Aman. A very few non-elves are known to have passed\nalong this road, including the Hobbits Frodo and Bilbo Baggins,\nand perhaps Samwise Gamgee and the dwarf Gimli as well.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Aman_ was a Quenya word that meant 'Blessed realm'.",

During the War of the Ring,\nthe abandoned city gained strategic importance as a crossing point over\nthe Anduin, both for the Men of Gondor and Orcs of Mordor. Translated,\nit means, “The Citadel of the Host of Stars”\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nRise and Decline\n\n\n\nThe city was founded by Isildur and Anárion near the end of the Second\nAge. Ruling Gondor jointly, they used Osgiliath.\n\nAt the heart of Osgiliath was a great stone bridge over the river. On\nthe bridge was a tower containing the famous Dome of Stars, which housed\nthe city's Palantír. Another important building (or possibly the same\none) was the Great Hall, which initially served as a throne room for\nIsildur and Anárion.\n\nThe decline of the city was greatly accelerated by the Great Plague of\nTA 1636.\n\nThe final blow came in TA 2475, when Uruk-hai of Mordor overran and\ncaptured Osgiliath. Though they were thrown back by Boromir, son of the\nthen-Steward Denethor I, Osgiliath was finally ruined and completely\nabandoned, and its great bridge was broken.\n\nThird Age\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n[Boromir's speech to the people and soldiers of Gondor after the defense\nof the city keeping the western shore in TA 3018]\n\nIn TA 3019, Beregond recounted to Pippin how Gondor recaptured East\nOsgiliath a few decades before the War of the Ring (“...in the days of\nthe youth of Denethor...”), for use as a military outpost and to secure\na crossing of the Anduin. In June 3018, however, a detachment of\nSauron's forces, led by a Nazgûl, again took the east bank, and the\ndefenders, led by Boromir and Faramir, were forced to retreat,\ndestroying the bridge they had built.\n\n[]\n\nOsgiliath was one of the few places between Rauros and the sea where\nlarge armies could cross the Anduin without needing many boats. Thus, a\nkey part of Gondor's defensive strategy after the loss of East Osgiliath\nwas to hold West Osgiliath and oppose any attempt at crossing the river.\nIt was while he was on guard in West Osgiliath in February 3019 that\nFaramir saw Boromir's funeral boat. But when the Witch-king and his\narmies attacked Gondor in March 3019, it was revealed that Sauron's\nforces had secretly built many floats and barges in East Osgiliath.\nThough they met with determined opposition from Faramir and the\nOsgiliath garrison, they were able to cross with fewer casualties than\nthe defenders had hoped, and Faramir ordered a general retreat to the\nRammas Echor. When he led the bulk of his army to besiege Minas Tirith,\nthe Witch-king left some reserves in Osgiliath. Gothmog later deployed\nthese forces against Gondor and their allies in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields.\n\nFourth Age and Beyond\n\nAfter Sauron was defeated and the Fourth Age began, Aragorn II Elessar,\nthe new King of Gondor, may have rebuilt the city, but he kept Minas\nTirith as his capital. He rebuilt the ruined northern city of Annúminas\nand proclaimed it capital of his Northern kingdom .",

It was known as a merry town that traded,\nmainly in food-supplies, for the skills and craft-pieces of the Dwarves.\nDale's toy market was the wonder of the North and the town was\nrenowned for its bells.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nIn TA 2590 King Thrór re-established the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nThe realm prospered and Northmen living to the south came up the River\nRunning and built Dale. The town shared in the prosperity of the\nDwarves and it was governed by the Lord of Dale, of whom the last was\nnamed Girion.\n\nIn TA 2770 Smaug descended upon the Dwarf-kingdom. Although the Men\nof Dale fielded warriors against the monster they could not prevent him\nfrom killing or scattering the Dwarves and then occupying the Lonely\nMountain. After the attack the dragon would crawl out of the Front Gate\nof the Mountain by night and carry away people (especially maidens) from\nDale to eat. The remaining population soon fled and the deserted city\nfell into ruins.\n\nThe death of Smaug and the Battle of Five Armies occurred in TA 2941.\nThree years after the battle, Dale was rebuilt by Bard the Bowman,\nwho had killed the dragon and was the descendant of Girion. Dale soon\nagain enjoyed prosperity: Bard founded the Kingdom of Dale and it\ngathered men from the Long Lake, the South, and the West. Lake-town was\nrebuilt and grew wealthy from traffic with Dale. Its people became\nknown as Bardings, after their new ruler.\n\n\n\nDuring the reign of King Brand, the grandson of Bard the Bowman, Dale\nserved as the capital for the lands he ruled, which extended far south\nand east of Lake-town. However, as Glóin revealed at the Council of\nElrond, in TA 3017 a messenger from Mordor came to ask King Dáin\nIronfoot at the gate to the Lonely Mountain for news of Hobbits and to\nask for Bilbo's ring. Messengers had also come to King Brand and there\nwere enemies gathering upon the Kingdom of Dale's eastern borders.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, the Easterlings crossed the border and moved\nto attack the city. On 17 March TA 3019 the Battle of Dale began. Not\nable to hold back the Easterlings the Bardings and their allies, the\nDwarves of Erebor, retreated into the Lonely Mountain, but lost Kings\nBrand and Dáin Ironfoot who were both slain at the Gate of Erebor. For\nseven days the Men and Dwarves barricaded themselves in Erebor until\nnews came from the south of the defeat of Sauron. The new kings of Dale\nand Erebor (Bard II and Thorin III Stonehelm), broke the siege and\nchased the Easterlings out of Dale. After the siege, the Bardings\nrebuilt Dale, with the help of the Dwarves. Bard also sent an emissary\nto the coronation of King Elessar.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word _dale_ means “valley”, as it was built in the Celduin valley\nbetween two arms of Erebor.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "text": "CARAS GALADHON (pronounced ) was the chief city of Lothlórien, at the\ncenter of the whole woodland.\n\nIn the Naith of Lórien, the heart of the Silvan Elven realm, it was\nbuilt in the middle of, on top of, and out of the Mallorn trees that\nGaladriel have received from Tar-Aldarion, the seventh High King of\nNúmenor, and was thenceforth the residence of Celeborn and Galadriel.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nCaras Galadhon is circular in shape and about three-thousand feet from\neast to west and was surrounded by a wall of green earth and a ditch or\na moat called the Deep Fosse. On the western border, a long stone road\noutside the Deep Fosse ran for many dozens of miles also surrounded the\ncity. The only entrance was in the south through a set of Great Gates\nacross a bridge in the Deep Fosse.\n\n\n\nThe city was a host of Mallorn trees where the elves lived in flets a\ntop the trees. Located in the city's center, atop the largest Mallorn in\nthe city, was the flet of Celeborn and Galadriel and the Chamber of\nCeleborn.\n\nOther notable features were Galadriel’s garden and her mirror both in\nthe southeast quarter.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe building of the city was probably started by the Silvan-speaking\nNandor elves who first settled the forest area of Lórien during the Time\nof the Trees under the light of stars, and was no doubt completed and/or\nadded to throughout the ages by the city's later Sindarin lords. No\ndoubt beautiful during the days of Amdír and his son Amroth, it was\ntheir successors' Celeborn and his wife Galadriel that made the city\ninto a blissful but rather isolated Elven haven.\n\n\n\nDuring the events of the War of the Ring, the Fellowship of the Ring was\nbrought through Lórien to Caras Galadhon, and there met the lords of the\nGaladhrim. Around the time of the siege of Minas Tirith Lorien was\nbesieged itself by Dol Guldur, three times.\n\nDuring the Fourth Age, after Galadriel had left Lórien, Caras Galadhon\nwas ruled by a lonely Celeborn as capital of a Lórien which now spanned\nboth sides of the river Anduin, but at some point during the age he left\nfor Valinor as well, and Caras Galadhon slowly became depopulated. It is\nunclear just how this came about since most of Lórien's people were\nSilvan Elves and, presumably, not necessarily inclined to leave\nMiddle-earth so soon after Sauron's fall; there are different references\nto the Fate of the Elves of Middle-earth scattered throughout Tolkien's\npublished works. Caras Galadhon is called a “great city” in the Lord of\nthe Rings, and the impression is that its population numbered in the\nthousands. However, the “Tale of Aragorn and Arwen” in Appendix A\ndepicts Caras Galadhon as wholly abandoned by the time of Aragorn II\nElessar's death.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _CARAS GALADHON_ means “Fortress of Trees”: from the Silvan\n_caras_ (“fortress”) and _galadhon_ (“of trees”). It may also be\ntranslated as “Fortress of Galadhon”. _Galadhon_ may be referred to\nCeleborn's father, Galadhon. In the First Edition of The Lord of the\nRings, _Caras Galadhon_ was spelled as _Caras Galadon_.",

When the wind blew\nthrough the branches, the sound of far off seas and the cries of extinct\nsea-birds could be heard. Niphredil and Elanor grew in the grass.\n\n\nHistory\n\nCerin Amroth was the mound of Amroth, where Elanor flowers grew, that\nstood in the heart of Lórien and held the house of that king before he\nwas lost over a thousand years before.\n\nAragorn comes to Cerin Amroth where he meets lady Arwen again giving her\nthe Ring of Barahir and where they both plighted their troth.\n\nAs the Fellowship of the Ring, fresh from Moria, entered into the beauty\nand safety Lothlorian and rest beside the stream Nimrodel, Frodo could\nhear a singing voice mingled with the sound of rippling water. Legolas\nremembered and sang the tragic tale of Amroth and Nimrodel.\n\nWhen Durin's Bane, the Balrog of Moria, was awakened, an evil arose that\nbegan to surround the peaceful forest of Lothlorien. This became too\nmuch for Nimrodel to bare. She and her love, the King of Lothlorien,\nAmroth, began their journey southwards towards the sea and the undying\nlands. Nimrodel became lost in the White Mountains and perished never\nfinding her way to Amroth who waited upon a boat tethered to the shore\nnear Belfalas. A storm arose, driving the boat out to sea. In\ndesperation and love, Amroth lept from the boat to swim to shore, hoping\nto find Nimrodel, yet drowned in the dark stormy waters of the ocean.\nBoth lovers died painfully yearning to find each other. In this way\nsorrow first came to the land of Lorien.\n\nUntil the days of the Fellowship, the singing of Nimrodel could be heard\nin the falls near where she lived. The voice of Amroth can similarly be\nheard when the wind blows into Lorien from the south, where he had\ndrowned. It is in the mingling of the waters of the stream of Nimrodel,\nwith the waters of the Anduin and eventually the ocean, the two lovers\nare symbolically united.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring stopped at Cerin Amroth as they were being\nescorted through Lórien to the Lord and Lady in Caras Galadhon by\nHaldir. Frodo could feel the southern wind blow upon Cerin Amroth,\ncarrying the sounds and sights of the southern ocean.\n\nFrodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee followed Haldir up to the flet built in the\ncenter tree while the others rested in the grass. Frodo saw Caras\nGaladhon from the flet. He could see Anduin the Great and Southern\nMirkwood corrupted by Dol Guldur.\n\nReturning to the grass at the foot of Cerin Amroth, Frodo finds Aragorn\nplaying with an elanor flower, lost in memory. He sees him as if clothed\nin white as a young lord tall and fair, speaking elvish to someone he\ncannot see. Aragorn speaks in Elvish “fair Arwen, fairwell” then looks\ntowards Frodo and smiles.\n\nIt was here where Arwen, after Aragorn's death, went to die, in the\nplace Aragorn had proposed to her, sometime before the spring of FO 121\nand was where her grave was located."

    "text": "BRETHIL\nwas a cluster of woodlands and the realm of the Haladin during the First\nAge of Middle-earth. The forest bordered by Dorthonion and was the\nnorthwest border of the Kingdom of Doriath, and lay between the rivers\nTeiglin (west) and Sirion (east). It was a dense, sparsely populated\nBeech forest.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBrethil was probably originally part of Doriath during most of the Years\nof the Trees. When the Girdle of Melian was set after the First Battle,\nthe Forest of Brethil was not included in it and was for the most part\nunsettled. However, King Thingol still held lordship over it.\n\nWhen Men came into the Beleriand, King Thingol gave his permission for\nsome of their peoples to settle there so long as they defended it. It\nwas to Brethil that the House of Haleth removed after dwelling east of\nthe river Gelion, settling mainly on the Hill of Amon Obel where upon\nstood Ephel Brandir, the main feature of the forest. They defended it\nfrom the Orcs until the late fifth century of the First Age, when much\nof their number was lost including their Lord Handir in a raid by the\nenemy. Some Drúedain also dwelt there.\n\nThe Haladin came to Brethil from the lands of Caranthir by way of\nEstolad. They had endured much hardship upon their long journey, but\nbegan to recover and multiply in the isolated forest. There they formed\nan alliance with Elu Thingol, King of Doriath. At need, Thingol sent\nBeleg Cúthalion with great force of his Sindarin Elves west to fight\nalongside Halmir son of Haldan, Lord of the Haladin. The combined force\ndestroyed a legion of Orcs, and the realm had peace for a time. Later,\nmany of the Woodmen of Brethil joined the muster of Húrin son of Galdor,\nclose kin of their lord Haldir, son of Halmir, and took part in the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nAfter the disastrous battle, the Haladin became even more reclusive.\nMany withdrew to Ephel Brandir, the home of their lord Brandir the Lame,\nupon Amon Obel. Years later, Túrin Turambar son of Húrin was brought to\nEphel Brandir, and became the de facto lord of the Haladin. The tragedy\nof the Children of Hurin ensnared the Haladin, and the forest was\neventually attacked by Glaurung, father of Dragons. He burnt a path\ndirectly towards Ephel Brandir, but Túrin managed to slay him at\nCabed-en-Aras upon Teiglin with his mighty sword Gurthang. Returning\ntowards Ephel Brandir, Túrin learned the truth about his wife Níniel,\nand he, Níniel and Brandir all perished. The final stroke of doom for\nthe Haladin in Brethil came when Húrin returned to Amon Obel and sparked\na civil war, which destroyed the bloodline of the House of Haldad.\n\nTúrin Turambar came here after the destruction of Nargothrond and a\nvisit to Dor-lómin to rest not long before his fight with Glaurung. The\nForest was Túrin's burial place as well Nienor Níniel and Morwen, as\nwell as the Haudh-en-Elleth, the mound of Finduilas. The grave of Túrin\nand Morwen, survived the ruin of Beleriand after the First Age, and thus\ndid a speck of the Forest of Brethil still exist as Tol Morwen.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Brethil_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Silver birch'.",

The Citadel\nwould have been around 500 feet across.\n\n\nLayout\n\nThe Citadel is set out this way: In the centre is the White Tower,\nrising to a great height. Behind is the large sprawling King's House,\nwhere the Kings of Gondor once lived. In front of the tower is the Place\nof the Fountain, a courtyard containing the White tree and a central\nfountain. Around the Tower are ringed several other important buildings,\nincluding Merethrond, the Feasting Hall. The Citadel is accessed via a\nwide tunnel through the hill that leads to a small gate. The wide cliff\nnarrows to its point around 200 feet beyond the Citadel. As with all the\ncity's levels, the Citadel has a high wall and seven towers.\n\n\nThe Place of the Fountain\n\nProbably the most important symbolic area of the city, the Place of the Fountain was the\nhome of the great White Tree. It was a large circular grass area, around\n50 feet wide, with the White Tree being the central feature. The\nfountain was positioned some way before the tree. It flowed into a small\npool, then back round to the fountain. The Tree symbolised Gondor, and\nwas the flag and emblem of the City Guards. The Tree was grown from a\nseed of Nimloth, the tree given to the Numenoreans by the Eldar. It was\nplanted by Isildur, and grew to symbolise the blessings of Men. But in\nthe third age the tree was withered, perhaps symbolising Minas Tirith's\ndecline. It was only with the crowning of Aragorn Elessar that a new\nsapling was founded, showing the City's rise to glory under the new\nKing.\n\n\nThe Tower and other buildings\n\nThe Tower of Ecthelion is a tall white stone structure, rising 300 feet\nabove the citadel. The elevation of the city means it's topmost floor is\n1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. It's name implies that it was\nprobably built by Denethor's father, Ecthelion, but it was possibly much\nolder. The Tower was used as a main business building, and contained\nseveral large council halls, and the imposing Throne Room. At the summit was the small\nchamber where Denethor kept Minas Tirith's Palantir. At the very bottom\nof the Tower, there were several rooms for the Guards of the City to\nlive and work in.\n\nThe House of Kings was a large building, with many halls and towers. As\none of the main buildings in the city, it would have been around 100\nfeet long. It was designed to accommodate the King and royal family,\nvisitors, guests and a large team of servants. The palace was no longer\nin use by the time Gandalf and Pippin came to the city; the last King,\nEärnur, having long since been killed.\n\nThe only other building Tolkien specifically mentioned was Merethrond,\nthe Hall of Feasts. This is where important guests to the city were\nentertained, and where important feasts and celebrations were held.\n\nThere were several other structures on the citadel, ringed around the\nTower, but none apart from the White Tower and the Feast Hall are\nimportant to the story of lord of the rings."

Before the Second Age, the\nBelegaer stretched from the Gap of Ilmen in the far north, to where it\nconnected to Ilmen and froze in the far south. Belegaer was more narrow\nin the north than in the south, with its widest part located near the\nGirdle of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Change of the World\n\nBefore Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps, the Belegaer did not exist\nas there was only a great land mass and Almaren in the Great Lake. After\nwhich, the Belegaer began as a large body of water lying between Aman\nand Middle-earth. It remained unchanged until the War for Sake of the\nElves during the Years of the Trees, when the Belegaer grew wider and\ndeeper and less evenly displaced. After the war, Ulmo pulled the willing\nElves on the isle of Tol Eressëa across the Belegaer to their new home\nin Aman.\n\nThe continent of Aman, the home of the Valar, formed the western edge of\nBelegaer. Before the ruin of Beleriand at the end of the First Age, the\nsea was narrow and covered with ice in the north, forming the harsh\nstrait of Helcaraxë. The rebelling Ñoldor fleeing Valinor crossed to\nMiddle-earth by ship and by way of the dangerous ice crossings on the\nHelcaraxë. Fëanor's host crossed by ship along the coasts while\nFingolfin's host made the difficult journey, coming up from Aman along\nthe shoreline and across the ices of the Helcaraxë.\n\nWhen the Valar declared war on Morgoth's tyranny in Middle-earth, the\nhost was ferried across the Belegaer by the Swanfleet's of the Falmari.\nAfter the War of Wrath, the Belegaer was widened again by the drowning\nof the Beleriand in Middle-earth. The Helcaraxë in the north was\nremoved, ending all land access to the Undying Lands.\n\nAfter the Changing of the World\n\nDuring the Akallabêth in the later Second Age, Eru “bent” the sea and\nmade the world round. Aman was removed from the world to another realm\nin Eä which only Elves and a chosen few could find, who would travel the\nStraight Road to Valinor. Now mortal mariners traveling into west\nsearching for the summit of Meneltarma, said to be in the middle of sea\nfound neither the summit or Aman only the New Lands set in the far\nwest.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Belegaer_ is of the Sindarin words 'beleg' which meant 'mighty' and\n'aer' or e_är_, meaning 'sea' (which is also present in the name\n_Eärendil_). The Quenya name of Belegaer, never used in published\nwriting, is _Alatairë_.\n\n\nNotable features\n\nIslands\n\n-   Tol Eressëa\n-   Enchanted Isles seaward of Tol Eressëa\n-   Númenor (Second Age only)\n-   Tol Morwen\n-   Tol Fuin\n-   Himling\n-   Balar (First Age only)\n-   Tolfalas, in the Bay of Belfalas\n\nBodies of water\n\n-   Bay of Eldamar\n-   Bay of Balar (First Age only)\n-   The Great Gulf (First Age only)\n-   Firth of Drengist (First Age only)\n-   Ice-Bay of Forochel (after First Age)\n-   Gulf of Lune (after First Age)\n-   Bay of Belfalas (after First Age)",

It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\n\nCourse\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the Pass of Sirion.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion) it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram (the Long Wall), where the ground fell\nsteeply. Three leagues southwards the Sirion exited the underground\ncaves at the Gates of Sirion. It then flowed southwards through\nNan-Tathren until it reached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\n\nTributaries\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; theAros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion and west along the Forest of Region (and also\ncontaining the waters of the Celon from the Hills of Himring and Himlad)\nwhich met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined Sirion in\nNan-Tathren.\n\n\nCrossing Points\n\nThe main crossing point was the Ford of Brithiach where the road from\nHimlad which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur crossed Sirion. King\nThingol of Doriath also kept secret ferries in Doriath to cross the\nriver.\n\n\nSettlements\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, which guarded the pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion (see below). After the Coming of Men, the Edainof the House\nof Haleth made their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled\nby Thingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the\ndestruction of Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built\nby Círdan and his people.\n\n\nIslands\n\nThe most important island in Sirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas\nTirith was built here by Finrod Felagund in the strategic location\ncontrolling the Pass of Sirion where it entered Beleriand between the\nEred Wethrin and the Echoriath. Shortly after Dagor Bragollach it was\ncaptured by Sauron and the island became known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nSirion is a Sindarin/Noldorin name which contains the element sîr.\nDepending on the meaning of the second element, the name could either\nmean “great river” or “land of waters” (-ion as augmentative suffix or\narchaic plural genitive suffix).\n\nIts name in Khuzdul was Gabilān, with the element Gabil - “Great”."

    "text": "GONDOLIN was a hidden city of the Elves located approximately in the\nmiddle of the land of Beleriand in Middle-earth. It was founded by\nTurgon the Wise, a Ñoldorin lord in the early First Age. It endured the\nlongest of all the Ñoldorin kingdoms in exile, lasting nearly\nfour-hundred years of the Sun.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAs recounted in _The Silmarillion_, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters,\nrevealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to the Noldorin Lord\nTurgon in a dream around the year FA 50. Under this divine guidance,\nTurgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale in FA\n53. Within the Encircling Mountains just west of Dorthonion and east of\nthe river Sirion, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides\nand a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden\nWay. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called\nAmon Gwareth. There Turgon decided to found a great city that would be\nprotected by the mountains and hidden from the Dark Lord Morgoth.\n\nFor nearly seventy-five years, Turgon and his people built Gondolin in\nsecret. After it was completed in FA 116, he took with him to dwell in\nthe hidden city his entire people in Nevrast — almost a third of the\nÑoldor — as well as nearly three quarters of the northern Sindar. The\ncity stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to Morgoth by\nMaeglin, Turgon's nephew, and sacked shortly thereafter by the Dark\nLord's forces.\n\n\n\nGondolin was described as this - “Now the streets of Gondolin were paved\nwith stone and wide, kerbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid\ngardens of bright flowers were set about the ways, and many towers of\ngreat slenderness and beauty builded of white marble and carved most\nmarvelously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains\nand the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees,\nbut of all these the greatest was that place where stood the King's\npalace, and the tower thereof was the loftiest in the city, and the\nfountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms and seven in\nthe air and fell in a singing rain of crystal; therein did the sun\nglitter splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by\nnight.

    "text": "ANGBAND, also known by its translation 'IRON PRISON', was the ancient\nfortress of Melkor under the Iron Mountains before the First Age, and\nfrom which he tried to subjugate Arda. It was destroyed at the\nconclusion of the War of Wrath. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nAngband was a primarily subterranean stronghold under the three volcanic\nmountains of Thangorodrim, the largest mountains in Middle-earth. Before\nthe Great Gate, there was a somber court area flanked by frightening\ncliffs and walled by the towers of a great battlement. Through the gate,\nthere was a long great tunnel leading to a 'labyrinthine pyramid' of\nstairs to corridors, tunnels, and smithy chambers. A tall chimney went\nfrom Morgoth's gigantic blast furnaces and smithies, up through the\nmountain to the smokey towers of Thangorodrim. There were also many\ntunnels leading to the slave quarters or vaults. At the foundation of\nAngband was the entrance to Morgoth's throne room in the Nethermost\nHall. There were also mines within Angband that extended deeper than\nMorgoth's throne room.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMelkor originally built Angband to guard against a possible attack from\nAman by the Valar, and placed it under the command of Sauron. However,\nat the initiation of the War of Powers, the assault of the Valar leveled\nAngband without much difficulty, and forced Melkor to flee to his\nprimary stronghold of Utumno. However, Angband's underground vaults and\ncaverns were left relatively intact after the Valar's onslaught, as they\nwere in great haste to capture Melkor for the sake of keeping the\nnewly-awakened Elves safe. After Melkor's defeat at Utumno, the Balrogs\ncame to Angband and went into hibernation in its ruined foundations.\nEventually, the Orcs began to multiply in great numbers in Angband's\nruins, and soon made their way south into Beleriand, threatening the\nDwarves and Thingol's kingdom. It is possible that Sauron remained in\nthe ruins of Angband with the Balrogs, as he had presumably been\ncommanding the fortress when it was attacked. However, it is not certain\nwhere Sauron dwelt during Melkor's imprisonment. After three ages,\nMelkor was released, destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, stole the\nSilmarils and escaped from Aman.\n\nAfter fleeing, Melkor, now named _Morgoth_ by his enemies, returned to\nMiddle-earth and re-delved the ruins of Angband, raising the\nvolcanic peaks of Thangorodrim over it. These peaks were created from\nthe slag and rubble caused by the re-delving of the fortress, and as\nsuch, it is likely that the rebuilt Angband extended for a considerably\ngreater distance underground than it's original incarnation had. From\nhis dark throne in the Nethermost Hall, Morgoth directed the war against\nthe Ñoldor who had returned from the West, and all the Free Peoples that\nsupported them in Beleriand. Ultimately, he achieved complete victory\nover them. At the end of the First Age, the Valar took pity on the\nÑoldor and instigated the War of Wrath, which not only utterly destroyed\nAngband but broke most of northern Middle-earth so throughly that it\nsank beneath the ocean.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier versions of Tolkien's mythology (see _The History of\nMiddle-earth_) Angband was called ANGAMANDO, which is the Quenya form of\nthe name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Angband_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'iron prison'.",

The mountain range is in between Rhovanion and Rhûn. The\nhills are east of the Lonely Mountain.\n\nThe Land\n\nThe Iron Hills were rich in many minerals and got their name from the\niron that was commonly found in the area. The Iron Hills used to be part\nof very large mountains called the Iron Mountains. Within these Hills\nwas the River Redwater, which joins to the River Running.\n\nInhabitants\n\nThe Dwarves in Iron Hills were the clan of Longbeards or Durin's Folk\nand so were the noblest Dwarves. They had friendly relations with the\nDwarves of the Lonely Mountains because Grór and Thrór's kinship was of\nsimilar in like and mind. The three kingdoms were very linked and relied\nupon each other for trade and support and of course the royal family of\nthe Dwarves were related. An example is the close friendship between\nThorin and his cousin Dain Ironfoot.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Iron Hills were probably used by the Dwarves of Durin's Folk for\nmany years, and the Old forest road was probably used as a trade route\nand as a means for the Dwarves of the east and west to communicate with\none another. The realm of the Iron Hills was formerly founded by Grór\nson of Dáin I in TA 2590 after the Dwarves were driven out of the Grey\nMountains, because of the continuing attacks by the Cold-drakes for the\nvast wealth of the mountains which became the death of the King Dain I.\n\n[The Location of the Iron Hills in Middle-earth]\n\nIn TA 2941, the Dwarf lord Dáin II Ironfoot of the Iron Hills led an\narmy of five hundred warriors to the defense of Thorin Oakenshield which\nthen joined in the Battle of the Five Armies and fought valiantly there.\nAfter Thorin's death after the battle, the vacant throne of the Lonely\nMountain passed to Thorin's cousin and friend Dain who then became its\nKing and the Iron Hills passed out of records afterwards but they may\nnot have been deserted, and it was possible that Dain and his son\nretained dominion over them.\n\n[A Dwarf Warrior from the Iron Hills]\n\n\nNotable Dwarves of the Iron Hills\n\nGrór\n\n-   As he was mentioned above, Grór was the son of the mighty Dwarf,\n    Dáin I and was also the founder and first ruler of the Iron Hills.\n\nNáin\n\n-   Náin was the son of Grór who was the founder of the Iron Hills. Náin\n    was killed during the Battle of Azanulbizar by the Orc lord Azog of\n    Moria.\n\nDáin II\n\n-   Dáin II was son of Náin and became the lord of the Iron Hills after\n    the death of his great father. He was considered a mighty Dwarf\n    because he killed the Orc Azog when he was at an age which was\n    considered young to the Dwarves. He became the King under the\n    Mountain after the slaying of Smaug and loss of Thorin II\n    Oakenshield in the Battle of the Five Armies until his death during\n    the War of the Ring.\n\nThorin III Stonehelm\n\n-   Thorin III was the son of Dáin II, after his father's death and soon\n    became the Lord of both the people of the Lonely Mountain and\n    possibly the Iron Hills. He was praised for helping to reconstruct\n    the Lonely Mountain and Dale. During his rule a new Dwarven\n    settlement was founded at Helm's Deep.",

The Tower of Ecthelion was used to bear the plain white\nstandard of the Stewards of Gondor of the City, which flew from its\npinnacle, and—at least during the last years of the Third Age. It is 50\nfathoms (300 feet) tall. The Tower stood in the center of the Citadel on\nthe seventh level of the city. In front of the Tower was the Place of\nthe Fountain where the White Tree of Gondor grew.\n\nIn the Tower Hall was the throne of the King of Gondor upon a dais, and\nat the foot the dais on the lowest step was a black chair where the\nSteward of Gondor would sit. There was a chamber high in the Tower and\nabove it in the summit there was a secret room where the Palantír of\nMinas Anor, called the _Anor-stone_, was kept.\n\nBelow the Hall was the buttery of Beregond's company, where the Citadel\nGuard (which Pippin became) would stay when not on duty.\n\n\nHistory\n\nKing Calimehtar first built the White Tower in TA 1900 in order to house\nthe Palantír. In TA 2698, the Tower was repaired and rebuilt by the\nSteward Ecthelion I, some three centuries before the War of the Ring,\nand for whom the Tower came to be named.\n\nThe elite military unit in Minas Tirith was called the Guard of the\nCitadel or the Guard of the Tower. At the time of the War of the Ring,\nBoromir and Faramir - the sons of the Steward of Gondor - each bore the\ntitle Captain of the White Tower. Boromir, the Steward's heir, was also\nthe High Warden of the White Tower.\n\nOn March 9, 3019, Peregrin Took got his first glimpse of the Tower of\nEcthelion as he rode with Gandalf to Minas Tirith:\n\n_Then Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high\nwithin the topmost wall, shone out against the sky, glimmering like a\nspike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle\nglittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and\nfluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze, and high and far\nhe heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets._\n\n-The Return of the King: chapter 1,“Minas Tirith”\n\nPippin met Denethor II, the Steward of Gondor, in the Tower Hall.\nDenethor's son Faramir came to the Tower Hall the next day, and Pippin\nand Gandalf learned of his encounter with Frodo and Sam in Ithilien.\nWhen Faramir was brought back to the city gravely wounded on March 13,\nDenethor retreated to his chamber high in the Tower with his son and\nwould not come down. In the secret chamber of the Tower, Denethor looked\ninto the _Palantír_ and saw images manipulated by Sauron that caused him\nto despair.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring on May 1, 3019, the standard of the Stewards\nof Gondor was raised for the last time. That day Aragorn was crowned\nKing and when he entered the Citadel; the standard of the Kings of\nGondor bearing the White Tree and the Stars was unfurled on the pinnacle\nof the Tower of Ecthelion.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIt was renamed the _Tower of Ecthelion_ after the Steward Ecthelion I\nwho rebuilt it.

    "text": "DOL GULDUR, also known as the HILL OF DARK SORCERY, was Sauron's\nstronghold and base of operations when he worked his sorcery in the wood\nunder the name of _The Necromancer_. It was located south of Mirkwood\nfor over twelve-hundred years in the Third Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nConstruction\n\nDol Guldur was established by Sauron after his return to Middle-earth\nsometime after TA 1000. Sauron became known as the Necromancer, and his\ntrue identity was long kept secret. Dol Guldur was built on the hill\nknown as AMON LANC (meaning “bald hill”), and had been the capital of\nOropher's Silvan realm. The Silvan Elves had fled north to the Black\nMountains (later the Mountains of Mirkwood) after Sauron's return from\nthe Downfall of Númenor. Later, after Sauron captured Amon Lanc,\nThranduil, son of Oropher, led his people over the Forest River, where\nthey remained. Sauron later remained there for hundreds of years.\n\nThe Fortress of the Necromancer\n\n\n\nThe White Council long feared the power in Dol Guldur might be Sauron,\nbut Saruman opposed assaulting it. However, Gandalf later went to Dol\nGuldur himself and discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. He\nthen informed the White Council, and Saruman was unable to protest. The\nWhite Council attacked Dol Guldur, and Sauron, not yet powerful enough\nto challenge them, fled to Mordor.\n\nSauron continued to increase his power over the next 100 years in his\nsearch for the One Ring.\n\nIn TA 2845, Thráin II, holder of the last of the Seven Rings of the\nDwarves, was imprisoned in Dol Guldur's dungeons. In TA 2850, Gandalf\nagain entered Dol Guldur, and found the dying Thráin. Gandalf was\nentrusted with the map and key to give to Thorin Oakenshield, Thráin's\nson, although Thráin could not tell Gandalf his own name or the name of\nhis son before he died. Gandalf confirmed Sauron was the master of Dol\nGuldur at that time.\n\nGandalf returned to the White Council and urged an attack on Dol Guldur,\nbut was overruled by Saruman. In TA 2941, Saruman finally agreed to an\nattack, which occurred at the same time as The Quest of Erebor. This was\ncarefully planned by Gandalf, so that Sauron and Smaug could not assist\neach other, as otherwise they surely would have done. The White Council\nattacked Dol Guldur, and drove out Sauron. Sauron fled to Mordor, his\nplans nearly ready. In TA 2951, Sauron declared himself openly and sent\nthree Nazgûl led by Khamûl to reoccupy Dol Guldur.\n\nDestruction\n\n\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, the forces of Dol Guldur were led by Khamûl,\nthe Ringwraith second in command to the Witch-king of Angmar. He and his\narmies made three assaults upon Lórien and Thranduil's realm in\nMirkwood, causing grievous damage to the outlying woodlands, but they\nwere driven back each time by the power of Nenya, Galadriel's Ring of\nPower, which only Sauron himself could have overcome. The elves, led by\nThranduil of Mirkwood and Galadriel of Lórien, led an assault on Dol\nGuldur and Galadriel herself threw down its walls, and laid its pits\nbare. Absolutely nothing of the fortress that had stood for 2,019 years\nwas left. Renamed back to AMON LANC, it became the capital of Celeborn's\nrealm of East Lórien in the Fourth Age, while he remained in\nMiddle-earth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Dol Guldur_ was Sindarin, meaning “Hill of Dark Sorcery,” from _dol_\n(“hill”) and _guldur_ (“dark sorcery”). It was previously known as AMON\nLANC, the “Bald Hill,” from _amon_ (“hill”) and _lanc_ (“bald”).",

    "text": "THE DOOR OF NIGHT (also called MORITARNON or TARN\nFUI) was a place set at the utmost West of Arda near the Void. The Door\nwas created by the Valar at the time of the making of the Sun and Moon.\nIt was vital in the cosmology of Middle-earth, forming the border\nbetween Arda and the void, as well as being the final prison of the\nrenegade Vala Morgoth Bauglir.\n\n\nCreation\n\nThe Door was created by the Valar as a gateway for the Sun to pass\nthrough. According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway\nthrough which to expel Morgoth. The following text describes the\ncreation of the Door in the _Ainulindale_:\n\n  _Thus came it that the Gods dared a very great deed, the most mighty\n  of their works; for making a fleet of magic rafts and boats with\n  Ulmo's aid - and otherwise had none of these endured to sail upon the\n  waters of Vai - they drew to the Wall of Things, and there they made\n  the Door of Night._\n\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Sun was to pass through the Door of Night as it travelled above\nArda. When the Sun passed through the Door, night would fall upon\nMiddle-earth. The Moon would then rise from its resting place and\ncontinue on its path over the Earth. The Sun would traverse the border\nof the Wall of the World, re-entering the world in the East, at the\nGates of Morning. At the same time the Moon would be sinking in the West\nand a new day would begin. At the conclusion of the War of Wrath, when\nEärendil the Mariner sailed to Aman to beseech the aid of the Valar,\nMorgoth was imprisoned outside the Door of Night. The following is told\nin _The Silmarillion_:\n\n  _“But Morgoth himself the Valar thrust through the Door of Night\n  beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void; and a guard is\n  set forever on those walls, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the ramparts\n  of the sky.”_\n\nAt the “End of Days” (which is referenced to even in _The Lord of the\nRings_ by Gandalf, Tom Bombadil, and others), Morgoth shall return as\nMelkor by breaking the Door of Night, precipitating the Last Battle\n(Dagor Dagorath).\n\n\nLocation\n\nA description of the location of the Door of Night is found in _The Book\nof Lost Tales Part One_:\n\n  _About the World are the Ilurambar, or Walls of the World. They are as\n  ice and glass and steel, being above all the imagination of the\n  Children of Earth cold, transparent, and hard. They cannot be seen,\n  nor can they be passed, save by the Door of Night. Within these walls\n  the Earth is globed: above, below and upon all sides is Vaiya, the\n  Enfolding Ocean. But this is more like to sea below the Earth and more\n  like to air above the Earth._\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Door of Night was likened to a huge gate of stone at the very edge\nof the world: the _Ilurambar_, invisible Walls of the World.\n\n  _There it still stands, utterly black and huge against the deep-blue\n  walls. Its pillars are of the mightiest basalt and its lintel\n  likewise, but great dragons of black stone are carved thereon, and\n  shadowy smoke pours slowly from their jaws._\n\n\nFate\n\nIn the _Book of Lost Tales Part One_ the fate of the Door of Night in\nthe West, and its counterpart, the Gates of Morning in the East, are\ndocumented as follows:\n\n  _For 'tis said ere the Great end come Melko shall in some wise\n  contrive a quarrel between Moon and Sun, and Ilinsor shall seek to\n  follow Urwendi through the Gates, and when they are gone the Gates of\n  both East and West will be destroyed, and Urwendi and Ilinsor shall be\n  lost._"

    "text": "ERIADOR was a large region situated in northwestern Middle-earth. It was\nlocated between the Blue Mountains (to the west) and the Misty Mountains\n(to the east).\n\n\nDescription and Climate\n\nAccording to _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, Eriador was about six-hundred\nmiles (approximately 965.5 kilometers) from east to west. It was\nmostly lowlands. Hill areas were mainly in around the realms of Arnor,\nthe Shire in the center of the region and in the far eastern parts near\nthe Misty Mountains. Plains and bottomlands were in the south and\nsouthwestern parts. A plateau area existed in the area where Rivendell\nand the Trollshaws were located. Eriador was largely made up of\nscattered woodlands with scrublands in the north and northeastern parts.\nThe rest were short grasslands mainly in the center of the region.\n\nThe climate was mainly humid with relatively mild to cold winters with a\nconstantly warm and moist prevailing wind blowing over the Blue\nMountains. In the northern part, cold and dry prevailing winds blow down\nfrom the polar north influencing the climate as well.\n\nMost of the population was concentrated in the center area around Arnor\nand the Shire and the dominant language was Westron at least by the\nThird Age.\n\nIts boundaries were:\n\n-   To the east, the Misty Mountains.\n-   To the north, the Ice-Bay of Forochel, which flooded part of the\n    lands of Morgoth after the War of Wrath.\n-   To the west, the Blue Mountains.\n-   To the south, the river Greyflood and the land of Enedwaith. After\n    the War of Wrath, part of the southwestern border lies along the\n    shores of Belegaer.\n\nImportant rivers were the Lune (Elvish _Lhûn_), the Brandywine or\n_Baranduin_ in Elvish and the Greyflood.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Second Age, and possibly much earlier, it was largely forested,\nbut Men cleared the land for farming and the massive old forests never\nrecovered. Much of it was encompassed in the early Third Age by the\nkingdom of Arnor, which later split into the rival kingdoms of Rhudaur,\nArthedain and Cardolan. The Shire occupies part of the former Kingdom of\nArthedain, while Bree and its neighbouring villages lie on the border\nwith the former Cardolan. The Barrow-wights dwell within ancient burial\nmounds constructed in the First Age by the Edain as they journeyed to\nBeleriand. Other important places in Eriador are Rivendell and the\nabandoned kingdoms of Eregion and Angmar.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second Age, large populations of both regular\nMen and Dunedain inhabited the region. There was also a group of\nNoldorin exiles living in Eregion, near Moria and also located in the\nwestern most region of Eriador (and also in Middle-earth) was the High\nElven Kingdom of Lindon, once the greatest and mightiest kingdom of\nMiddle earth. Sauron's assault on the Elves of Eregion laid waste to\nthat land, and many of the Elves of the Lindon fell in the War of the\nLast Alliance.\n\nEven after his fall, Sauron's evil spirit acted through his agents, such\nas the Witch-king of Angmar, and he also concocted virulent plagues\nwhich swept over the land. Between warfare against the surviving\nDúnedain kingdoms, the plagues, and the general lawlessness sweeping\nover the land, the population dropped considerably. The Angmar War\nturned Eriador into a beautiful, but mostly wild and untamed land, and\nthe only concentration of Elves was either in the valley of Rivendell or\nLindon.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERIADOR_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'Lonely land' or\n'Lone-lands'.",

Originally, the name referred only to\nthe area around the Bay of Balar, but in time the name was also applied\nto the entire land. The root of the word, ''Beler ''or _Balar,_ is\nbelieved to refer to the Maia Ossë, who often dwelt at the shores of\nBalar. The War of Wrath at the end of the First Age brought the\ndestruction of the entire continent, and its descent into the sea.\n\n\n\n\nGeography\n\nTo the west and south, Beleriand had a long coast with the Great Sea\nBelegaer; to the north were the highland regions of Hithlum, Dorthonion,\nand the hills of Himring; to the east the Blue Mountains reached nearly\nto the sea. The land of Nevrast in the north-west was sometimes\nconsidered part of Beleriand.\n\nSirion, the chief river of Beleriand, running north to south, divided\nthe continent into West Beleriand and East Beleriand. Crossing it east\nto west was a series of hills and a sudden drop in elevation known as\nAndram, the Long Wall. (The river sank into the ground at the _Fens of\nSirion_, and reemerged below the Andram at the _Gates of Sirion_.) To\nthe east of the Long Wall, was the River Gelion with its six tributaries\ndraining the Blue Mountains, in an area known as Ossiriand or the Land\nof Seven Rivers. The River Brithon and the River Nenning were the two\nlesser rivers of the western land of Falas.\n\nIn the year FA 583, Beleriand was mostly destroyed by the War of Wrath\nof the Valar against Morgoth. Only a small section of East Beleriand\nremained, and was known as Lindon. In addition, fulfilling a prophecy,\nthe graves of Túrin Turambar and Morwen also survived as the island Tol\nMorwen. Part of Dorthonion became Tol Fuin, and the Hill of Himring\nbecame the island of Himling.

    "text": "TOL ERESSËA, known also as the LONELY ISLE, was a large island located\noff the eastern coast of Aman.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTol Eressëa was originally an island that stood in the middle of the\nBelegaer far from either the coasts of Aman or Middle-earth. Ulmo\nuprooted it and with the help of his servants used it as a ferry to\ntransport the willing three kindreds of the Elves back and forth twice\nfrom Middle-earth to Aman. After that, the host of Olwë remembering the\nstar-light of their home in eastern Middle-earth begged to the Maia Ossë\nto stay their journey. Their request was granted at the behest of Ulmo.\nOssë rooted it permanently to the bottom of the sea, and never moved\nagain afterwards. The isle came to rest forever just off the eastern\nshore of Aman in the Bay of Eldamar, and the Teleri dwelt there ever\nafter. This long separation from the Vanyar and the Ñoldor caused the\nTelerin language to sunder from Quenya of the other Calaquendi. So that\nthe Teleri could see the light of Valinor, the Valar opened a cleft in\nthe Pelori so that the light of the Two Trees shone upon it, making its\nwestern shores green and fertile. Many Teleri lived here until their\nlord Olwë built the city Alqualondë on the northwestern shore of\nAman.\n\n\n\nWith the end of the First Age, many of the Eldar of Middle-earth exiles\ncame to it, and lived on the island of Tol Eressëa. Sometime during the\nearly Second Age, the Elves that chose to settle there built Avallonë in\nthe eastern part of the island. It was also where most of the elves\nvisiting Númenór came from at least until the shadow fell upon the\nNúmenóreans. The Numenoreans yearning for the light of the east would\noften gaze at the great tower of Avallonë, which they could see from the\nwesternmost parts of their homeland. When Ar-Pharazôn the Golden broke\nthe Ban of the Valar and sailed to the Undying Lands with his Great\nArmament, Tol Eressëa was surrounded by its fleets before going to\nTirion, but it is not known whether its people were assailed by this act\nor not.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn early versions of Tolkien's legendarium, the island was later visited\nby Ælfwine (or Eriol), an Englishman from the Middle Ages, which\nprovided a framework for the tales that later became _The Silmarillion_.\nOver time it had become a land of many beautiful places and interesting\nsites such as: Alalminórë, the Land of Elms, and Tavrobel. Along with\nUlmo, his great whale Uin was also in charge to carry the island to the\nBay of Eldamar.\n\nThe Cottage of Lost Play, which Eriol visited, was one of the more\nfamous spots in Tol Eressëa at which many stories were told (the stories\nthat became the _Lost Tales_) of ancient times.\n\nAt different eras of development of his mythology Tolkien either saw Tol\nEressëa as the island of Britain, or as the island of Avallon, off the\ncoast of Britain beyond the Straight Path near Valinor In some of the\nlater writings and letters he began to see the Shire and Rivendell to be\ncloser to England geographically. Some of the ideas of Avalon (and\nArthurian legend) that had been associated with the island can also be\nseen in the name of the city Avallonë. Tolkien even echoed this in a\nletter when he stated he had given Frodo and Bilbo an “Arthurian\nending”.\n\n    But when Morgoth was thrust forth, the Gods held council. The Elves\n    were summoned to return into the West, and such as obeyed dwelt\n    again in Eressëa, the Lonely Island, which was renamed Avallon: for\n    it is hard by Valinor.\n\n\nNotable dwellings\n\n-   Avallonë\n-   Cottage of Lost Play\n-   House of the Hundred Chimneys\n-   Kortirion",

    "text": "GLITTERING CAVES, also known as AGLAROND, was the cave system located\nbehind the Deeping Wall of Helm's Deep.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe Glittering Caves was an immense, beautiful, and ore-laden cave\nsystem that extended deep down into the White Mountains for many miles\nand consisted of many different paths, tunnels, and chambers. A small\nstream ran down through The Narrows of Helm's Deep and into the caves\nand was its source of water. Gimli's poetic description of the caves to\nLegolas in _The Two Towers_ is considered by some to be Tolkien's most\nbeautiful writing in the trilogy. According to the _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_, it extended some 4,000 feet into the mountain.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the War of the Ring\n\nGlittering Caves was one of the two fortresses built by Numenoreans to\nguard the Fords of Isen, Angrenost (later Isengard) being the other.\nLike Angrenost to the north it was initially well - guarded, but as the\npopulation of Calenardhon (the later Rohan) dwindled it was increasingly\nless supplied and deemed unimportant, until it was only ruled by a\nhereditary small guard who intermarried much with Dunlendings.\n\nWhen Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the Éothéod, the\nGlittering Caves was transferred to the Rohirrim who used it for refuge\nduring war, strife, and the storage of provisions, but guard duty of the\nFords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan. The fortress then\nunderwent repair with help from the masons of Gondor. The Gondor guard\nwas merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the\nkeep of Gondor. The shared garrisoning of the fortress continued for a\ntime until soon it was solely part of Rohan and maintained only by the\nRohirrim.\n\nDuring the reign of Helm Hammerhand, the Dunlendings attacked from\nIsengard and across the river Isen conquering parts of Rohan. Edoras was\noverran and sacked, and King Helm was forced to lead much of his people\ninto the caves where they remained during the Long Winter of TA 2758 and\nTA 2759. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to\nfight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed HORNBURG.\n\nWar of the Ring and afterwards\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, the Hornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim\nduring the Battle of the Hornburg after being driven back by the Host of\nSaruman. After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, who had fought mightily in\nthat battle, was allowed to settle a colony of Durin's folk there,\nleading a host of Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain and became the first\nLord of the Glittering Caves. From this stronghold, after it had been\ncarefully constructed, Gimli forged a new gate for Minas Tirith made of\nMithril and Steel. Gimli and Legolas made a pact of friendship, that\nwhen the wars of their age ended, that Gimli should walk in the deep\nwoods of Fangorn and that Legolas should behold the jeweled-splendour of\nthe Glittering Caves. The Glittering Caves lay in front of a huge and\nvery beautiful cave system which proved irresistible to him. Gimli\nbecame known as the 'Lord of the Glittering Caves', although this new\nrealm was presumably under the overlordship of Thorin Stonehelm, his\nkinsman and heir of the lordship of all Durin's Folk. The Dwarves of\nGlittering Caves restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring,\nand it became a shared fortress between them and the Rohirrim.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, it is called AGLAROND, which means “Caves of Glory” or\n“Caves of Light”. It comes from the words _aglar_ (“glory, light”) and\n_rond_ (“cave”). It is called GLÆMSCRAFU, the “Caves of Rodiance”,\nin Rohirric,which in actuality was an Anglo-Saxon word.\n",

    "lotr_page_id": "6541",
    "text": "TUMLADEN was a green field located in the middle of the Encircling\nMountains where the great city of Gondolin was founded and located.\n\nIn the middle of Tumladen was a small hill made of smooth stone, called\nafterwards the Amon Gwareth. This stone hill was the foundation for the\ncity Gondolin built by Turgon. Tumladen and the city it contained\nremained secret and safe for 503 years since the Return of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth. It was, however, betrayed by the father of Túrin Turambar,\nHúrin Thalion, when Húrin shouted at the mountains encircling the city\nto let Turgon know to open the gates and let him in (this was an\nill-fated attempt, for no one heard him, and Húrin despaired). As Húrin\nwas under the spell of Morgoth, the Dark Lord finally learned of\nGondolin's location through Húrin. In this way, Húrin doomed the city.\nMorgoth waited for a couple more years before he finally invaded the\ncity, with the help of the traitor Maeglin, who showed him where the\nvale could be found exactly and how it could be attacked (since Great\nEagles guarded its borders). Through his treachery, Maeglin help to lie\nwaste the fair vale of Tumladen and the city that sat on Amon Gwareth in\nthe center of the vale, Gondolin.\n\n\nDescription\n\nTumladen was described by J.R.R. Tolkien as a “...green jewel among the\nencircling hills...” and as a “...green plain among the mountains.” He\nalso describes it as being very fair with the black and smooth Amon\nGwareth in the center of the vale.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTumladen was a great lake in the ancient days of Beleriand. It was\nlocated east of the upper waters of Sirion, as was found out later by\nthe Elves, in the middle of the Encircling Mountains. Turgon was shown\nby Ulmo, a Vala, where it was located by means of a dark tunnel that ran\ndeep under the mountains, hollowed out by streams that ran to join the\nSirion. In this way, Turgon discovered the vale of Tumladen, and thought\nit indeed to be a perfect place to construct his city that was supposed\nto be modeled after the great city of Tirion upon the green hill Tuna,\nback in Valinor. Indeed, after many years of labor, Gondolin did come to\nrival Tirion with its beauty and splendor. As mentioned above, Tumladen\nand the city it held, Gondolin, survived for more than 503 years, the\nlongest lasting of the Ñoldorin kingdoms. The vale was betrayed, as\nmentioned above, by Maeglin and in so doing, Maeglin finally destroyed\nthe last kingdom of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. It was there that the\nbattle of Ecthelion of the Fountain and Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs,\ntook place in the very square of the King. There it was also that they\nslew each other, and in so doing, Ecthelion had felled the mightiest of\nBalrogs, even though he himself had died also. And so, with the\ntreachery of Maeglin, the fair vale of Tumladen and the city upon Amon\nGwareth, Gondolin, the last kingdom of the Ñoldor, were destroyed and\nruined.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Tumladen_ is a name coming from two Sindarin roots. One of the roots is\n_tum_ (pronounced _toom_), which means a valley. The other Sindarin root\nis _lad_, which means a plain or a valley. Both parts of this name\ndoubly imply and tell that Tumladen is a plain/valley, a very\ninteresting combination of Sindarin roots on the part of Tolkien.\n\n\nOther\n\nIn the Third Age, Tumladen was a valley near the southeastern end of the\nWhite Mountains. When Pippin arrived in Minas Tirith, he saw vehicles\ncarrying the old, the children and the women to take refuge in Lebennin\nthrough the vales Tumladen, Lossarnach, and the mountain-villages.\nTumladen was placed at the source of River Sirith in _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_."

    "name": "Black Gate",
    "lotr_page_id": "3061",
    "text": "The BLACK GATE, or “MORANNON”, was the gate of Udûn in\nnorthwestern Mordor, and the most fortified and direct entrance into the\nland of Mordor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nThe Black Gate was set in an impregnable black stone and iron wall that\nstretched from the Mountains of Ash in the north to the Ephel Duath in\nthe west. The wall has been estimated to be 60 feet high and 250 feet\nlong, with each half of the great gate being 90 feet wide, and set on\nlarge stone wheels. Behind the gate were gigantic circular stone\nramparts, and when the gate needed to be opened, two pairs of\nMountain-trolls who were tethered to gigantic beams pushed their way\naround their rampart's track, gradually levering open the gate and\nallowing for the incoming or outgoing of Mordor's armies.\n\nInset within the wall were myriads of archers, spearmen, bowmen, and\nhundreds of thousands of Orc troops ready to defend Mordor. The Gates\nthemselves may have been made of the same indomitable stone that\nconstitutes Orthanc, so hard that even the Ents could not dent it.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was originally a gate built by Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor in the\nSecond Age, to protect and guard the northern entrance into Mordor and\nto prevent invasion at the gap between the Ash Mountains and the Ephel\nDúath. It was probably built with the help of the power of the One Ring,\nlike the Barad-dûr. After Sauron's fall after the Battle of Dagorlad, it\nbecame a garrison of the Men of Gondor. In Gondor's early days, when it\nwas building towers and cities such as Minas Ithil and Cirith Ungol\nclose to Mordor's border, it raised the two great Towers of the Teeth,\nNarchost and Carchost, which were built on either side of the wall and\nwere tall enough to overlook it.\n\nIt was backed up on the other side by the Isenmouthe, and protected by\nthe castle of Durthang to the west; it was redesigned to prevent\nanything evil from entering or leaving Mordor, shielding the outside\nfrom it - and it from the outside. The reconstruction of Minas Ithil,\nTower of the Rising Moon, as well as the construction of Cirith Ungol\nwas also done for the same purpose.\n\n\n\nHowever, they eventually failed and they were taken over by the servants\nof Sauron. Once taken by the Enemy, they became a monument of dread,\nfear, evil, and awe by anyone who saw the gate. Thus the Ringwraiths and\nOrcs re-entered Mordor, eventually overrunning the garrisons and\ninhabiting and taking them for their own uses. It was at this time that\nthe Nazgûl took the tower of Minas Ithil, having its name changed to\n_Minas Morgul_.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Frodo and Sam had a chance to go through the\nBlack Gate when they arrived at Mordor, but it was so heavily fortified\nand guarded by the forces of Mordor that they turned away and were led\non a different route into Mordor by Sméagol. They also saw an army of\nEasterlings enter the gate.\n\nThe Black Gate was the site of the last valiant battle of the War of the\nRing, in the East. In March 3019, the Army of the West commanded by\nAragorn Elessar and numbering some 6,000 men (plus one Elf, one Dwarf,\nand a Wizard and one Hobbit) arrived at the Black Gate and challenged\nthe many remaining armies of Mordor. Their intention was to draw the\nwatchful Eye of Sauron away from Mount Doom, to allow Frodo the\nRing-bearer to cast the One Ring into the Crack of Doom and destroy it.\nThe delay worked and the Ring was destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom,\nfollowing which the Black Gate and the Towers of the Teeth immediately\ncollapsed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Black Gate's literal Sindarin translation, _Morannon_, means “Black\nGate” from _môr_ (“dark, black”) and _annon_ (“gate, door”).",

    "text": "BARAD EITHEL also known as EITHEL SIRION was the main fortress and\ncapital of the realm of Fingolfin and Fingon, while it endured.\n\nIt was located in the mountainous eastern foothills of the Ered Wethrin,\nat the source of the River Sirion, just outside Hithlum, some sixty\nmiles from Thangorodrim. It was attacked and besieged many times during\nthe First Age by the forces of Morgoth. When Men came into the service\nof the Ñoldor, it was entrusted to the House of Hador. It survived the\nDagor Bragollach but was conquered and occupied by the enemy after the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel guarded a pass over the Ered Wethrin into Hithlum, the\nrealm of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor. There were several\nmountain fortresses along the eastern border, but Barad Eithel was\nFingolfin's primary stronghold. Cavalry based at Barad Eithel patrolled\nthe plains of Ard-galen.\n\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455, rivers of fire from Angband\nturned the grassy plain of Ard-galen into Anfauglith. The Elves of\nHithlum and their allies the Men of Dor-lómin were driven back to the\nmountain forts.\n\nDuring the Siege of Angband, Barad Eithel lay at the heart of the\nNoldor's defences, and also guarded the passes westward into Hithlum.\nThroughout the siege, Elves of Fingolfin's people would patrol the green\nfields of Ard-galen, holding Morgoth within his fortress at Angband,\nclose by to the north.\n\nThat changed in the Dagor Bragollach, when the plains of Ard-galen were\noverrun with rivers of fire and turned to scorching dust. Armies of Orcs\nassailed Fingolfin's city, but it held firm, though Hador, the Lord of\nDor-lómin and his younger son Gundor were both lost in its defence, in\nfront of the fortress's walls. Looking out across the burning desert in\ndespair, Fingolfin set out from Barad Eithel to challenge Morgoth to\nsingle combat, and was lost. His son Fingon became the High King of the\nÑoldor in his place, and took up his rule from Eithel Sirion.\n\n\n\nThough the Siege of Angband had been broken, Barad Eithel still held,\nand so the passes into Hithlum remained secure. Morgoth resolved to\nbreak this defence, and sent another army seven years after the Dagor\nBragollach to overcome Fingon's forces. Again they were repulsed, but\nGaldor was slain in the attack, where his father Hador had fallen just\nseven years before. Galdor was killed by an arrow. His son Húrin then,\ndrove the enemy forces back from Barad Eithel and pursued them across\nAnfauglith.\n\nWhen the Elves came together for a vast new assault on Morgoth, Barad\nEithel was the staging post for the western armies. It was from there\nthat the soldiers of Fingon swept across the dusty remnant of Ard-galen,\nin the glorious beginning of the battle that would turn to the tragedy\nof the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Gelmir's brother Gwindor was on the outworks\nof Barad Eithel, and in his anger he launched a premature attack against\nMorgoth's forces. Fingon ordered his troops to follow and advance on\nAngband, but despite their initial success they were ultimately defeated\nin the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon was killed and no Elves returned to\nHithlum, which Morgoth gave to the Easterlings.\n\nThough the fate of Barad Eithel in that battle is polemical described,\nthe fact that Fingon's realm was destroyed and Hithlum occupied must\nmean that the fortress at Eithel Sirion was captured or destroyed. By\nthe last years of the First Age, if Fingolfin's mountain fortress was\nnot in the hands of the Orcs, it would have fallen into ruin and\ndecay.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _BARAD EITHEL_ means “Tower of the Well” in Sindarin from\n_barad_ meaning “tower” and _eithel_ meaning “well, spring”.",

    "lotr_page_id": "200",
    "text": "ARNOR, also known as the NORTHERN KINGDOM, was a kingdom of men located\nin the land of Eriador in Middle-earth. The name probably means “Land of\nthe King”, from Sindarin ARA- (high, kingly) + (N)DOR (land).\n\n\nHistory\n\nArnor was founded in SA 3320 by Elendil and sons who went on to found\nthe southern realm of Gondor. The history of the two kingdoms is\nintertwined; both kingdoms are known as the Realms of the Dunedain in\nExile.\n\nBefore the foundation of Arnor there was already a sizable Númenórean\npopulation living there, a result of the slow emigration of Numenoreans\nwhich had started under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion. Before the\narrival of the Dunedain, Arnor was home to Middle Men of Edain stock,\nand the early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous population.\nArnor was originally favoured over the more southern regions (Gondor)\nbecause the Elves under Gil-galad lived near it across the river Lhûn.\nHowever, in later days after the Numenoreans fell under Sauron's shadow\nthey settled more to the south. This led to a situation where Elendil\narrived in an area populated by people who, unlike his own Numenoreans,\nwere mainly still friends with the Elves, and unlike Gondor to the south\nin Arnor much knowledge of the Elder Days was preserved.\n\nArnor's second king Isildur (also King of Gondor) was killed in TA 2 by\norcs in the disastrous Battle of the Gladden Fields. His three eldest\nsons were killed with him, but the fourth and youngest, Valandil,\nsurvived and became king of Arnor (TA 2 or 10?).\n\n\n\nBecause Valandil and his heirs did not claim the throne of Gondor the\nrealms were split, but Arnor's ruler kept the title High King, whereas\nin the south the ruler was just _King._ At its height, Arnor borders\nextended from the Ice-Bay of Forochel in the north, the river Greyflood\ndown to Belegaer in the south, the river Hoarwell in the east, and the\nriver Lune in the west. The capital city was Annúminas, and the realm\nincluded other cities such as Fornost, Tharbad, Lond Daer, and Tyrn\nGorthad.\n\nDecline\n\nHuman folly and the plots of a deathless evil had undone this dream.\nArnor was no more; divided into the three kingdoms of Arthedain,\nCardolan and Rhudaur, the Dunedain of the North spent their strength in\nfoolish, petty wars and while corruption and ambition sapped their\nstrength, enemies gathered on their frontiers. Arnor's capital was\nAnnúminas on Lake Evendim, but by TA 861 Fornost Erain had become the\ncapital instead as Annúminas became depopulated.\n\nAfter the death of its tenth king, Eärendur, in 861, Arnor was shaken by\ncivil war between the three sons of Eärendur. The eldest son, Amlaith,\nclaimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the\nregion of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the\nkingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur.\n\nArnor was refounded in name by Arthedain's king Argeleb I, when Cardolan\nplaced itself under the suzerainty of Arthedain. However, even Arthedain\nwas eventually destroyed. The people of Arnor were mostly wiped out by\nthe wars, but the Hobbits survived in the Shire, men survived in Bree\nand probably other villages, and the Dunedain of Arnor created new homes\nin the Angle south of Rivendell, where some of them became known as the\nRangers of the North.\n\nReunited Kingdom\n\nAragorn II as King Elessar refounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the\nReunited Kingdom, and made Annúminas his summer capital. After the fall\nof Sauron, Arnor was safe again for human population, and although it\nremained less populated than Gondor to the south, in time Arnor became a\nmore densely populated area again, even when it had dwindled in size due\nto the independence of the Shire.",

The hill was long\nand sloping and the wood went almost to the summit.\n\nWhile it was considered the centre of Gondor, it would be better\ndescribed as the spiritual centre of Gondor, as it was _the high place\nnearest to the centre of a line from the inflow of the Limlight down to\nthe southern cape of Tolfalas and the distance to it was equal from the\nFords of Isen and Minas Tirith_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Tomb of Elendil\n\nAfter the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur defined the bounds of Gondor\nand, upon discovering that this was the centre of Gondor, he entombed\nhis father Elendil here and it was at this time that the hill's name\nbecame AMON ANWAR, as Isildur had called the protection of the Valar\nupon that hilltop, and they had granted it. Isildur swore all those\npresent to secrecy and forbade anyone save an Heir of Elendil from\ndisturbing it. The tomb then stayed untouched by any save the Kings of\nGondor and later, their Stewards.\n\nThe Oath of Eorl\n\nIn the time of the twelfth Ruling Steward, Cirion, Gondor was faced with\na massive invasion of a land they could not protect, Calenardhon which\nhad been depopulated in the Great Plague of 1636, though it had not been\ngreatly populated to begin with. Cirion called upon the aid of the\nÉothéod and in return for their aid, he surrendered Calenardhon to them,\nUntil the Great King should return. Although by this time the lives of\neleven Stewards had passed before him, no one in Gondor ever expected\nthat the King would return.\n\nCirion took Eorl, the Lord of the Éothéod to the hallowed site of AMON\nANWAR and there before the Tomb of Elendil they swore what would be in\nlater days known as the Oath of Eorl, giving Calenardhon to the Éothéod,\nand promising eternal friendship between the two Kingdoms. As Amon Anwar\nwas no longer the centre of Gondor, rather its border, Cirion removed\nthe Casket that Isildur had set upon the hill two thousand years earlier\nto Rath Dínen, the Silent Street, where all other Kings of Gondor were\nentombed.\n\nThe Warning Beacon\n\nAmon Anwar was the seventh and last of the Warning beacons of Gondor\nwhich gave the final warning or message to Rohan. It stood overlooking\nthe Firien wood which was just outside the border of Rohan near the\nMering Stream. Also, chain of Warning Beacons was established along the\nline of the White Mountains to warn South Gondor of danger in\nCalenardhon, and vice-versa. Later this was used to warn Anorien of\nDanger to Gondor and Rohan also. The westernmost and last built beacon\nwas situated upon AMON ANWAR, and was only created after the Tomb of\nElendil was removed to Rath Dínen, as no Lord of Gondor, King or steward\nhad permitted the construction of a beacon whilst Elendil still remained\nthere.\n\nEven after Elendil was removed to Minas Tirith, the Awe still remained\nupon the hill, and its surrounding forest. The Beacon Wardens would live\nclose to the Summit only for short watches in specially constructed\ncabins. Except when there was a noise of animals in the forest, or of\nfolk along the road, they would find themselves speaking to their\ncompanions in whispers, as if they expected a great voice from long ago\nto speak. The Wardens were the only people to live in those woods, and\nwere glad when their tour of duty was over. The mound of Elendil's Tomb\nremained upon the top of the hill from the time that Isildur hallowed it\nuntil the Changing of the world, always in a well-kept, green field.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMON ANWAR_ was Sindarin for 'Hill of Awe'.",

    "text": "The NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was part of the Royal Road linking Arnor and\nGondor. The North-South Road was approximately 600 miles long. It ran\nbetween Fornost in the north and Isengard in the south. At the Fords of\nIsen, the North-South Road merged with the Great West Road.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe northern half of the North-South Road was in Eriador. From Fornost,\nthe Road ran south to Bree. Outside the West-gate of Bree, the\nNorth-South Road intersected with the Great East Road. At this major\ncrossroads was the inn called The Prancing Pony, where travellers\nbrought news from the South as well as goods such as Pipe-weed, which\nfirst came to Bree and the Shire via the North-South Road.\n\nThe North-South Road then moved on through the narrow passage called the\nAndrath between the Barrow-downs and the South Downs. South of the\nAndrath, a road to the Shire branched off the North-South Road. The\nNorth-South Road then curved southeastward through the region of\nMinhiriath.\n\nAt the city of Tharbad, the Road crossed the River Greyflood on the\nsouthern border of Eriador. Originally, the Road went over the Bridge of\nTharbad. On either side of the Bridge, the Road was built up on\ncauseways to traverse the surrounding marshland. However, the Bridge was\ndestroyed by floods in TA 2912 and all that remained was a dangerous\nford.\n\nThe southern half of the North-South Road passed through Enedwaith,\nwhich at one time nominally belonged to Gondor but was essentially a\nborderland between Gondor and Arnor. East of the Road in Enedwaith was\nDunland at the foot of the Misty Mountains.\n\nAt the southern end of the Misty Mountains, the North-South Road curved\neastward through the Gap of Rohan and ended at the Fords of Isen. Just\nwest of the Fords a road branched north to Isengard. East of the Fords\nwas the Great West Road to Minas Tirith and Osgiliath.\n\nTogether the North-South Road and the Great West Road formed the Royal\nRoad, or Great Road, which was the main route by land between Gondor and\nArnor. The two Kingdoms were founded in 3320 of the Second Age. Each was\nresponsible for maintaining their own stretch of the Road, and together\nthey built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad and its causeways.\n\nAfter the Great Plague of TA 1636, Gondor and Arnor were considerably\nweakened and could no longer keep the Road and Bridge in repair. The\nNorth-kingdom fell in TA 1974 and Fornost at the northern end of the\nNorth-South Road was abandoned. The causeways near Tharbad eventually\ndisintegrated and the marshes encroached on the Road. In the spring of\nTA 2912 after the Fell Winter, floods caused the Bridge to collapse.\n\nFewer and fewer travellers used the North-South Road and it became\novergrown with grass, so that the people of Bree called it the Greenway.\nHowever, during the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age,\nunwelcome travellers began to come up the North-South Road from the\nSouth. Some were honest refugees, but many were troublemakers, including\nagents of Saruman. Early in 3019, there was fighting in Bree, and the\nShire was taken over by Saruman's agents.\n\nThe Hobbits expelled the Men from the Shire in the Battle of Bywater on\nNovember 3, and the Rangers of the North returned from the war and dealt\nwith the other troublemakers. The North-kingdom was reestablished by\nAragorn, King Elessar, and the North-South Road was open to travellers\nonce more.\n\n\nNames & Etymology\n\nThe NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was called the GREENWAY in later years by the\nBree-folk because it had become disused and overgrown with grass. It was\nsometimes called the NORTH ROAD and the OLD SOUTH ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD. (Note that the Great East Road was\nalso referred to as the Great Road.)"

    "text": "FORNOST, also known fully as FORNOST ERAIN (Sindarin 'Northern fortress\nof the Kings' from _for(n)_ (north) + _ost_ (fortress); NORBURY OF THE\nKINGS or simply NORBURY in Westron), was a city in Eriador of the\nkingdom of Arnor. It was located at the south end of the North Downs,\nabout 100 Númenórean miles north of Bree. It was eventually abandoned\nand fell into ruin, and became popularly known as DEADMEN'S DIKE. At the\ntime of the events of _The Lord of the Rings_ (TA 3018 – 3019), Fornost\nhad been abandoned for about a thousand years, and “even the ruins of\nKings' Norbury were covered with grass.”\n\n[The location of Fornost on Middle-earth map.]\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt is not known when Fornost was founded or when the Kings of Arnor\nmoved there from Annúminas. In TA 861, when King Eärendur died, Arnor\nwas divided into three kingdoms, Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur.\nEärendur's eldest son, Amlaith, who became King of Arthedain, had the\nepithet, “of Fornost,” suggesting that Fornost immediately served as the\ncapital of Arthedain; it may have also been the capital of Arnor before\nthe partition.\n\nFornost was located along the southernmost edge of the North Downs. As a\nmilitary fortress, it served to guard the gap between the North Downs\nand the Weather Hills against incursions by the forces of Rhudaur or\nAngmar. The Palantir of Annúminas may have eventually been relocated to\nFornost; that of Amon Sûl was taken to Fornost when the Tower of Amon\nSûl fell to the Witch-king's forces in TA 1409.\n\nEarly in TA 1974, Fornost, along with the rest of Arthedain, fell to a\nfull-scale invasion from Angmar, and most of its inhabitants were killed\nor driven over the Lune. King Arvedui, after resisting for a time on the\nnearby North Downs, fled into the northern wastes and was eventually\nlost in the Ice-Bay of Forochel. The Witch-king then set up his\nresidence in Fornost, and populated the city with “evil folk”. The next\nyear, a fleet from Gondor, led by Eärnur, landed at Mithlond. Along with\nallies from Lindon, Rivendell and the former territories of Arnor, they\ndefeated the Witch-king of Angmar on the plains west of Fornost; though\nhe escaped, Angmar's army was utterly destroyed.\n\nAt the end of the war, the northern Dunedain, now led by Arvedui's son\nAranarth, were too few in number to rebuild their nation or maintain\ncities. Fornost was not resettled, and gradually fell into ruin. The\nDúnedain, who became a secretive and wandering people known in Eriador\nas Rangers, visited Fornost, but most other folk avoided the ruined\ncity; the Men of Eriador called it “Deadmen's Dike” and many believed it\nto be haunted.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Fornost Erain was rebuilt by King Elessar.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nVideo games\n\n[As seen in _The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the\nWitch-king_]\n\nSeveral video games have depicted Fornost so far.\n\n-   _The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king_\n    features it as a site of battle during the Witch-king's campaign.\n-   _The Lord of the Rings Online_ depicts Fornost as overrun by\n    Angmar's forces in TA 3018, players are encouraged to fight through\n    the city and cleanse it of the Servants of the enemy.\n-   In _The Lord of the Rings: War in the North_, Fornost is where\n    Sauron's lieutenant, Agandaur, made a deal with the Witch-King of\n    Angmar to help conquer Middle-Earth with Orcs he gathered in the\n    North, until a small band of free peoples (Elladan, Elrohir, Eradan,\n    Andriel, Farin and Beleram) forces him to flee.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Fornost_ literally translates in Sindarin as “Northern City”, from\n“forn” meaning north, northern and “ost” meaning city, fortress or large\ndwelling. The same basic roots are present in Quenya _Formenos_, the\n“Northern Fortress” Fëanor built in Valinor.",

    "text": "BREE was a village, of Men and hobbits, in Middle-earth, located east of\nthe Shire and south of Fornost in Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBree was an ancient settlement of men in Eriador by the time of the\nThird Age of Middle-earth, but after the collapse of the Kingdom of\nCardolan, which had claimed it, Bree continued to thrive without any\ncentral authority or government for many centuries. Bree had become the\nmost westerly settlement of men in all of Middle-earth by the time of\nthe War of the Ring, and became one of only three or four inhabited\nsettlements in all of Eriador. At the time of The Lord of the Rings,\nBree-land was the only part of Middle-earth where Men and Hobbits dwelt\nside by side in peace. Being located on the most important crossroads in\nthe north, on the crossing of the Great East Road and the Greenway,\ntravellers would pass through Bree. The Prancing Pony is equipped with\nrooms, but the local people do not seem accustomed to many travellers.\nHobbits from the Shire would also occasionally visit Bree. The Rangers\nare also familiar to Bree-folk, though they are suspicious of them. The\ndwarves dwelling in Blue Mountains (Ered Luin), such as Thorin\nOakenshield, would be likely to pass through. Gandalf is a frequent\npasser-by as well. Thus Bree is the place where, seemingly by accident,\nGandalf and Thorin once met. They were both thinking about the same\nproblem: the dragon Smaug at the Lonely Mountain (Erebor). The meeting\nled to the undertaking of the Quest of Erebor, which resulted in the\ndeath of Smaug and the finding of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, a day's ride east from the village along the\nroad lay The Forsaken Inn, according to Aragorn, although nothing else\nis known of that place. Directly west of Bree were the Barrow-downs and\nthe Old Forest. Bree was the chief village of BREE-LAND, a small wooded\nregion near the intersection of the main north-south and east-west\nroutes through Eriador. [A map of Bree-town from The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth] It was not unheard of for Hobbits of the Shire to visit to\nBree. This was especially true of the more adventurous Brandybucks, who\nlived just over a day's journey from the place. People there could\nrecognize Shire-folk from their accent.\n\nDespite raising some of their own “leaf,” the Bree-folk very much\nenjoyed Shire Pipe-weed from the Southfarthing.\n\n\n\nIn _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Frodo Baggins met Strider (Aragorn) at\nthe largest inn in Bree, The Prancing Pony, owned by Barliman Butterbur.\nSeveral of the Ringwraiths attempted to kill the hobbits, but Strider\nanticipated this, and the hobbits were in a front parlor with him when\nthe Black Riders struck. Frodo and his companions later traveled through\nBree on their way home and found things rather worse off there.\n\n\nVillages\n\nThere were three villages in Bree-land in addition to Bree proper:\n\n-   STADDLE was populated primarily by hobbits who made a living from\n    light agriculture, including Pipeweed. Staddle was on the\n    south-eastern side of Breehill, sitting south of Combe and Archet.\n    It was the only of the villages (other than Bree itself) visible\n    from the Great East Road.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   COMBE was populated primarily by Men, with some hobbits, all of whom\n    made a living from agriculture. Combe was situated on the borders of\n    the CHETWOOD and on the edge of Bree-hill, between the villages of\n    Archet and Staddle.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   ARCHET was the furthest north. Located in the Chetwood, it was\n    populated primarily by Men.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name BREE means “hill” in Brythonic, a Celtic language, referring to\nthe fact that the village of Bree and the surrounding Bree-lands were\ncentered around a large hill. According to Tom Shippey, Tolkien was\ninspired by the actual town of Brill.",

    "text": "NARGOTHROND (Sindarin IPA: ) was the Elven stronghold built by Finrod\nFelagund, delved into the banks of the river Narog in Beleriand during\nthe First Age.\n\n\nDescription\n\nSimilar to the structures of many underground Dwarven cities,\nNargothrond consisted of many miles of caves and tunnels of various\nshapes and sizes carved through the rock, which was possibly limestone.\nThere were three Great Halls centered around the other tunnels and\ncaves, where the Lord of the city no doubt sat. The deepest of the caves\nwas the Innermost Chamber where Glaurung later hoarded up the remaining\ntreasures of Nargothrond and sat upon them until he left. Lúthien lived\nin a southwestern cave chamber during her stay there. The realms\narmouries were in several chambers south of the Great Halls. The main\nentrance through the Doors of Felagund to Nargothrond facing river Narog\none came into a large chamber, which was about five-hundred feet from\nthe Great Halls of Felagund.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of Peace\n\nInspired by Menegroth in Doriath, and seeking a hidden place from which\nto be safe from the forces of Morgoth, Finrod established it in the\nearly years following the return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, in the\nCaverns of Narog beneath the forested hills of TAUR-EN-FAROTH on the\nwestern bank of Narog. He was aided by the Dwarves of Nogrod who also\nmade for him the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves.\n\nHowever, Finrod was not the first to delve in those caves: it had first\nbeen inhabited by the Petty-dwarves, who called it NULUKKIZDÎN (Khuzdul\nIPA: ) before they were driven out. Originally, a narrow path along the\nbanks of the river could only reach it, but later a bridge was built\nacross the Narog.\n\nFinrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his Quest for the\nSilmaril, being succeeded by his nephew Orodreth. However, the Sons of\nFëanor, Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at this time and\ncarried a great influence with its people, sowing fear and distrust of\noutsiders. After Finrod's death was reported they were exiled in\ndisgrace.\n\nFall of Nargothrond\n\n[Túrin and Glaurung, by woutart \n\nSince its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a\nsecretive war against Morgoth, hunting his forces by stealth and ambush\nrather than going to open war. When Túrin was led there by Gwindor,\nhowever, he grew high in the esteem of Orodreth, Lord of Nargothrond,\nand counseled a different strategy.\n\nTúrin Turambar became one of the chief captains, persuading the people\nto abandon their long standing policy and instead fight openly against\nMorgoth.\n\nTúrin persuaded Orodreth to build the Bridge of Nargothrond to allow\nspeedy passage of forces into the field. Orodreth built the bridge from\nhis doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth. In\ncenturies of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of\nNargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new\nbridge removed the defence of the River Narog. Glaurung the dragon was\nsent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city. After\nthe defeat of the army of Nargothrond at the field of Tumhalad in FA\n495, Glaurung and his army of Orcs came south, crossed the bridge, and\nsacked the city, killing or selling some of the inhabitants into\nslavery. The survivors, then went to seek refuge in Doriath, and that's\nhow Thingol knew of the fall of Nargothrond.\n\nGlaurung remained there until FA 499 when he went northeast to Brethil,\nto confront Túrin Turambar who eventually slew him. Though the realm was\nno more, Mîm the Petty-dwarf took up residence in caves claiming it and\nits treasures as his own in payment for the sufferings of his people,\nuntil Húrin came and slew him for his betrayal of his son. The treasure,\nincluding the Nauglamír, was then brought to the Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and given to King Thingol. Afterwards, the caves were\ndestroyed during the War of Wrath, along with all of Beleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NARGOTHROND_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Narog-fortress-vaulted\nhall'.",

It is described as “The Last Homely\nHouse East of the Sea”, referencing towards Valinor, which is west of\nthe Great Sea in Aman.\n\nLocation\n\nThe peaceful, sheltered town of Rivendell was located at the edge of a\nnarrow gorge of the river Bruinen (one of the main approaches to\nRivendell comes from the nearby Ford of Bruinen), but well hidden in the\nmoorlands and foothills of the Misty Mountains.\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nRivendell was established by Elrond in the Second Age of Middle-earth in\nSA 1697. During the War of the Elves and Sauron, Eregion was laid waste\nand Elrond brought the survivors to Rivendell, soon Sauron laid siege to\nit but was eventually beaten back. Following the establishment of the\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men the hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil march\nto Imladris and laid camp in there to prepare their arms and then\nproceeded southeast to Dagorlad.\n\nThird Age\n\nWhen Angmar rose to power and conquered Arthedain, Elrond sent\nGlorfindel and a host of elves to meet with the armies of Earnil and\nCirdan thus honoring the Alliance of Elves and Men. After the fall of\nAngmar the heirs of Isildur were fostered in Rivendell.\n\nQuest for Erebor\n\n\n\nDuring the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins and the Company\nof Thorin stopped off at Rivendell. Bilbo described it as “a perfect\nhouse, whether you like food or sleep or story-telling or singing, or\njust sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.”\nAfter the quest, Bilbo and Gandalf returned there and were greeted again\nby Elrond and the elves.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nYears later, Frodo Baggins and his Hobbit companions journeyed to\nRivendell, where they met with Bilbo, who had retired there after his\neleventy-first birthday. Several other Elves, Dwarves and Men also\narrived at Rivendell on separate errands; at the Council of Elrond\nthey learn that all of their kind are related to the fate of the One\nRing, and they must decide what to do about it. In the end, it was the\nHobbits who influenced the decision.\n\n\n\nThere was a large hall with a dais and several tables for feasting.\nAnother hall, the Hall of Fire, had a fire in it year-round with carven\npillars on either side of the hearth; it was used for singing and\nstorytelling on high days, but stood empty otherwise, and people would\ncome there alone to think and ponder. The eastern side of the house had\na porch at which Frodo Baggins found his friends once he had awakened,\nand was where the Council of Elrond was held.\n\n\n\nRivendell is protected from attack (mainly by the River Bruinen, Elrond,\nand Elven magic), but Elrond himself said that Rivendell is a place of\npeace and learning, not a stronghold of battle.\n\nAfter the War and Elrond's departure, his sons Elladan and Elrohir lived\nin Rivendell. Their grandfather Celeborn lived with them for a while\nuntil he finally took ship and sailed West.\n\nInhabitants\n\nSeveral notable elves lived in Rivendell:\n\n- Elrond, Lord of Rivendell and the House of Elrond - Celebrian, Lady of\nRivendell and Elrond's wife - Elladan, a son of Elrond. Stayed in\nRivendell with Elrohir into the\n\n   Fourth Age and (perhaps) beyond\n\n- Elrohir, a son of Elrond.

Its Westron term _RIVENDELL_ comes from the English\n_riven_ (“to tear apart or split”) and _dell_ (“valley”).\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe valley of Imladris (within which the town of Rivendell is situated)\nwas based upon the landscape of Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland.

The Elves\npassed through it on their Great Journey from Cuiviénen into the Far\nWest - it was where they made their first long stop before continuing\nonward. Thereafter, Mirkwood was the dwelling of the Wood-elves (the\nNandor, elves descending from the wandering Teleri elf Lenwë) for many\nthousands of years. The Sindarin Elf Oropher, one of the Grey-elves, who\nwas the grandfather of Legolas, established the Woodland Realm proper,\nand it become the primary settlement of the elves from the Second Age\nonward. It was around this time that Men, possibly ancestors of the\nNorthmen, began making permanent settlements in and around the forest.\nWhen Oropher was killed in the War of the Last Alliance, the kingship\npassed to his son Thranduil.\n\nMirkwood had been called Greenwood the Great until around the year TA\n1050, when the shadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it, and men\nbegan to call it Mirkwood, or Taur-nu-Fuin and Taur-e-Ndaedelos in the\nSindarin tongue. From then on, Mirkwood became a haunted place inhabited\nby many dark and savage things. Sauron established himself at the\nhill-fortress of Dol Guldur, an old Elven fortress that Oropher had\ncontrol of, on Amon Lanc within its southern region, and drove Thranduil\nand his people ever northward, so that by the end of the Third Age they\nwere a diminished and wary people, who had entrenched themselves within\nthe Mountains of Mirkwood. The Old Forest Road (also called the Dwarf\nRoad or Men-i-Maugrim) crossed the forest east to west, but because it\nwas so close to Dol Guldur the road was mostly unusable. The elves then\nmade a path farther to the north, which ended somewhere in the marshes\nsouth of the Long Lake of Lake-town.\n\n[Light peering through the thick trees of Mirkwood]\n\nQuest to Erebor\n\n[Entrance to the Elvenking's Halls]\n\nBilbo Baggins, along with Thorin Oakenshield and his band of Dwarves,\nventured into Mirkwood during their quest to regain the Lonely Mountain\nfrom the dragon Smaug. There, the dwarf Bombur fell into the Enchanted\nriver. Later, they came across many great Giant Spiders also known as\nthe Spawn of Ungoliant. Shortly after the Dwarves' escape, they were\ncaptured by the elves. After or during these events the White Council\nattacked Dol Guldur, and Sauron fled to Mordor, his influence in\nMirkwood diminished for a while. Years later Gollum, after his release\nfrom Mordor, was captured by Aragorn and brought as prisoner to\nThranduil's halls. He escaped during an Orc raid, and fled south to\nMoria.\n\nAfter Sauron was vanquished at the conclusion of the Third Age, the\ndarkness was lifted from Mirkwood, and Thranduil gave it the name _Eryn\nLasgalen_ (Sindarin for _wood of green leaves_), similar to its old name\n_Eryn Galen_, or _Greenwood_.",

    "text": "HARAD, fully named _HARADWAITH_, was the immense realm located south of\nGondor and Mordor. The Men of Harad were called _Southrons_ or\n_Haradrim_ (“South-multitude”).\n\n\nGeography\n\nHarad lay between the sea of Umbar to its west and Khand to its\nnortheast, and was divided into two main provinces: Near Harad, which\nwas the closest to both Mordor and Gondor, and Far Harad, nearest to the\nland of Umbar. Harondor, otherwise known as South Gondor, was a buffer\nzone in the very north of Harad between the lush, verdant grasslands on\nthe Gondor side of the Anduin and the inhospitable dunes of sand to the\nfar south, and was contested over by Gondor and Harad. The river Poros\nformed Harondor's northern border, while the river Harnen formed its\nsouthern border. Its climate was most likely a semi-arid grassland but\npresumably more fertile than Harad. Its boundaries extended roughly from\nthe Anduin to the western flank of Mordor and stopped around an\nimaginary line protruding horizontally from the bay of Umbar. On the\nnortheast it was bordered by the Mountains of Shadow, and it ran west to\nthe Bay of Belfalas.\n\nThe boundary between Near Harad and Khand is not described, and it is\nunclear how far east Near Harad extended. The majority of Near Harad is\ndesert, described by Gollum as where the “yellow face is bright and\nterrible”. In the southeast of Near Harad, a natural gulf fed far into\nthe landmass, and a large river flowed inland from there to the\nnorthwest, later forking. One branch of the river flowed westwards\ntowards Umbar, and the other northeast. Neither the gulf nor the rivers\nwere given names by Tolkien.\n\nThe boundary between Near and Far Harad is indistinct, but compared to\nthe other regions Far Harad was immense, covering all the territory\nrelatively equivalent to Africa. Far Harad was large enough that it most\nlikely had an extremely varied climate. Much of the southern extents of\nFar Harad were covered in forests and jungle. The great Mûmakil, called\nOliphaunts in legend by the Hobbits, were native to this area. The\nMûmakil were rarely seen outside of Far Harad after the Third Age.\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\nHarad's tribes were divided - at least in the minds of the men of\nnorthwestern Middle-earth - into those of Near and Far Harad, although\nthere were many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Those of\nNear Harad were swarthy, with black hair and dark eyes, whereas the\npeople of Far Harad had black skin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the First Age, the men of these lands were among the lesser men\nwho were instructed by the voyaging Numenoreans in the basic arts of\ncivilization. This went on for some time until the middle of the Second\nAge when the Numenoreans turned their backs on wisdom and became their\noverlords.\n\nFrom the latter part of the Second Age, many of the Men of Harad were\ndominated by the Numenoreans, as were many other peoples whose lands\nincluded a coastline. Shortly before the War of the Last Alliance, two\nNúmenórean lords, named Herumor and Fuinur, “rose to great power amongst\nthe Haradrim”, but their ultimate fate is not recorded.\n\nThird Age\n\nFor many centuries of the Third Age, many Haradrim were still ruled by\nBlack Númenórean Lords and ultimately, the Harad fell under the\ninfluence of Mordor for much of the Age.\n\nMuch of Far Harad was a jungle, although there also was a desert. In Far\nHarad lived the great beasts known as Mûmakil or Oliphaunts native to\nFar Harad used by the Haradrim as moving war towers.\n\nNear Harad later formed an alliance or maybe even a coalition of some\nsort with the Corsairs of Umbar, and was involved in a series of\ncontinual battles with Gondor over South Gondor or Harondor. Anciently\nits northern border was held to be the river Harnen, but by the time of\nthe War of the Ring all the land south of the river Poros was under the\ninfluence of the Haradrim.\n\nFourth Age\n\nAfter the revival of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor in the\nFourth Age, many of the Haradrim were pardoned and allowed to live in\npeace. They were required to relinquish South Gondor and Umbar, but\nremained a free people. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Harad_ means “South”. In Quenya, it was HYARMEN.[A\n“Haradrim Palace” in the BFME games]\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n-   In _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II_, warriors\n    from Harad are prominently featured.",

    "text": "RHOVANION or WILDERLAND was a large region of northern Middle-earth. The\nGreat River Anduin flowed through it, and the immense forest of\nGreenwood the Great was a part of it.\n\nProperly speaking Rhovanion was the name of a small region east of\nGreenwood, which later was the Kingdom of Rhovanion, but the name was\nused for all of Wilderland by the late Third Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst Age\n\nIn the First Age the Elves passed through it during the Great Journey,\nand much later the Atanatári (Fathers of Men) followed them. It is not\notherwise mentioned until the Second Age.\n\nSecond Age\n\nRhovanion played host to two Silvan Elf kingdoms ruled by Sindarin\nlords: Northern Greenwood and Lórinand (or Lórien).\n\nThe great battlefield (or Dagorlad) of the War of the Last Alliance\nagainst the host of Sauron lay in the south of Rhovanion, and in the\nGladden Fields of the Great River the High King of Gondor and Arnor,\nIsildur, son of Elendil, was killed.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn the early Third Age, it was a quite populated area: in the north lay\nthe Dwarven kingdoms of Erebor and the Dwarf halls in the Ered Mithrin,\nand the Mannish kingdom of Dale, in the north of the Great River Anduin\nlay the Mannish realm of Éothéod, and in and around the south and east\nof Greenwood the Great lived the Men of Rhovanion.\n\nIn TA 1248 Rómendacil II of Gondor destroyed all camps of the\nEasterlings even beyond the Sea of Rhûn, and a strong alliance with\nRhovanion was forged. The King of Rhovanion at this time was Vidugavia,\nand Prince Valacar of Gondor served in his army. Vidugavia's daughter\nVidumavi married Valacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar\nin TA 1432, which led to the Kin-strife in TA 1437. Eldacar fled to\nRhovanion, and with a Rhovanion army he reclaimed his Kingdom in TA\n1447.\n\nIn the north of Greenwood lived the Silvan elves ruled by Thranduil, and\nin the south of Greenwood and across the river in Lórinand ruled Amdír\nand later Amroth. In the far south, near the great falls of Sarn Gebir,\nwatched the northern guard of Gondor, and in the valleys of the Anduin\nlived Stoors (Hobbits).\n\nIn TA 1636 the Great Plague devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half\nits people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in TA 1851 the Wainriders\noverran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but\nin TA 1899 Rhovanion revolted, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from\nthe west. Rhovanion was freed but left extremely weakened. Many Men of\nRhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant\nrelatives.\n\nIn circa TA 2460 Sauron returned as the Necromancer he took residence at\nDol Guldur in the south of Greenwood. And Greenwood became evil, and was\nrenamed Mirkwood. The Dwarves of Erebor and the Men of Dale were\ndestroyed and scattered when the Dragon Smaug took Erebor, and Gondor\nretreated from the Falls. Some Men still lived along the forest, notably\nthe Beornings and the Men of Esgaroth upon the Long Lake. The Men of\nÉothéod removed south at the invite of Gondor, and settled the plains of\nCalenardhon, later Rohan. After being driven out of Erebor the Dwarves\nrelocated, some went to the Iron Hills, but most went to the Ered Luin\nin Eriador.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Kingdoms of Erebor and Dale were\nrestored as a result of the death of Smaug and the Battle of Five\nArmies, and Sauron was removed from Mirkwood by the wizard Gandalf.\nDuring the War of the Ring it held off an invasion by Sauron's forces,\nand after Sauron was defeated Mirkwood was clean again, and renamed\n_Eryn Lasgalen_, or “Wood of Greenleaves”. Some time during the Fourth\nAge Gondor claimed large parts of it.\n\n\nBoundaries\n\n-   To the east: the River Running and the inland Sea of Rhûn.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   To the north: the Grey Mountains and Iron Hills, home of the\n    Dwarves.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   To the west: the range of the Hithaeglir, or Misty Mountains.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   To the south: the line marked by the Limlight river, Anduin, Emyn\n    Muil, Dagorlad, and the Ered Lithui.\n\nImportant rivers were the Anduin or Great River, the Celduin or Running,\nand the Carnen or Redwater.\n\nMajor features were the forest of Mirkwood, and the Long Lake of\nEsgaroth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Rhovanion_ is Sindarin for “wilderland” and contains _rhovan_, with\nthe place-name ending _-ion_.\n\n_Wilderland_ was a Hobbit name.

    "name": "Lothlórien",
    "lotr_page_id": "722",
    "text": "LOTHLÓRIEN was both a forest and elven realm located next to the lower\nMisty Mountains. It was first settled by Nandorin elves, but later\nenriched by Ñoldor and Sindar, under Celeborn of Doriath and Galadriel,\ndaughter of Finarfin. It was located on the River Celebrant, southeast\nof Khazad-dûm, and was the only place where the golden Mallorn trees\ngrew.\n\nGaladriel's magic, later revealed as the power of her Ring Nenya,\nenriched the land and made it a magic forest into which evil could not\nenter without difficulty. The only way that Lothlórien could have been\nconquered by the armies of Mordor is if Sauron had come there himself\nwielding the One Ring, for against that power the Elves could not\ntriumph.\n\nAlthough Sauron's recovery of the One Ring was the great threat to\nLórien, if Frodo were to destroy the Ring the power of Nenya would fade\nand Lothlórien would cease to be a magical realm, but that was\npreferable to the enslavement of the Elves that would result if Sauron\nwere victorious.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nLórien, like Thranduil's kingdom of northern Mirkwood, was settled by\nSilvan Elves of Nandorin descent some time during the First Age and was\ncalled Lindórinand (Vale of the Land of the Singers). By the Second Age,\nSindarin Elves had enriched its population, and they were ruled by a\nSindarin lord, Amdír. The last Sindarin Lord of Lórien was Amroth, who\nwent to Edhellond near Dol Amroth in south Gondor in search of Nimrodel,\nand was lost at sea. After his time the Silvan Elves of Lórien long had\nno lords, until Galadriel and her husband Celeborn travelled there from\nEregion (Hollin). They brought with them a gift given to them by\nGil-galad, given to him by the seventh High King of Numenor,\nTar-Aldarion: seeds of the great Mallorn trees whose boughs were filled\nwith leaves of gold and whose wood was silver. He gave them to Galadriel\nand Celeborn because the trees wouldn't grow in his own land. The\n_mellyrn_ grew well in Lindórinand, and it was later famous for its\ngolden trees.\n===Third Age=== \n\nThe Golden Wood was relatively close to Mirkwood and Dol Guldur. Around\nthe time Sauron's forces were attacking Minas Tirith, Dol Guldur sent\nforces to assault Lothlórien as Gondor fought at the Battle of the Black\nGate. There were three assaults in total, but though the outer woods\nwere ravaged, the lands inhabited by the Elves were protected thanks to\nboth Elven skill and Galadriel's power (Mordor could not have destroyed\nLórien unless Sauron himself had arrived). After the three assaults\nfailed, Lórien eventually sent its own forces to cast down Dol Guldur.\nThis attack proved successful and Galadriel cast the walls down.\n\nAfter the War\n\n\n\nAfter Galadriel left for Valinor, ...the Elves of Lórien were ruled by\ntheir lord Celeborn alone, and the realm was expanded to include a part\nof southern Mirkwood, but it appears to have slowly been depopulated\nduring the Fourth Age until all Elves were gone. In “The Tale of Aragorn\nand Arwen,” the timeless Elven kingdom is depicted as being wholly\nabandoned by the time of King Elessar's passing. Even after the\nassaults on Lórien by Sauron's forces during the War of the Ring, there\nmust have been several thousand Silvan Elves remaining in the land.\n\nGaladriel bore Nenya on a ship from the Grey Havens into the West,\naccompanied by the other two Elven Rings and their bearers. With the\nRing gone, the magic and beauty of Lórien also faded, along with the\nextraordinary Mallorn trees that had lived for centuries, and it was\ngradually depopulated. By the time Arwen came there to die in FO 121,\nLothlórien was deserted and in ruin.\n\nAfter the death of her husband Aragorn II Elessar in FO 120, Arwen\nretreated there to Cerin Amroth in FO 121 where she gave up her life and\nwas buried there.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name LOTHLÓRIEN means “Dream-flower”, from the Sindarin _loth_\n(“blossom, flower”) and Ñoldorin _lórien_ (“dream, slumber”).\n\nOther Names\n\nThis forest, originally known by its Silvan names LAURELINDÓRINAN (Land\nof the Valley of Singing Gold) and LÓRINAND (Golden Valley), was renamed\nLOTHLÓRIEN (Lórien of the Blossom) in memory of the Lórien the Ñoldor\nleft behind; but the name was often shortened to Lórien (“Land of Gold”,\nalthough it carried within it also the meaning of “dream”). Treebeard\nreferred to the word LOTHLÓRIEN as “Dreamflower”. Other names given to\nthe land include the Rohirric name DWIMORDENE (from _dwimor_ “phantom”,\nan allusion to the perceived magic of the Elves), and the Westron name\nTHE GOLDEN WOOD.",

    "lotr_page_id": "7514",
    "text": "_'Lake-town, OR Esgaroth_', known fully as “ESGAROTH UPON THE LONG\nLAKE”, was a small settlement and community of Men in the north-western\npart of the Long Lake in the Rhovanion. The town was constructed\nentirely of wood and stands upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the\nLong Lake, south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. It seems\nthat the town's prosperity was built on trade between the Men, Elves and\nDwarves of northern Middle-earth.\n\nIt was also known as the final resting place of the Dragon Smaug, whose\nbones ended up at the bottom of the lake, and by whom it was destroyed.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nLake-town may have been separate settlements established on the same\nsite, one predating Smaug's destruction of Dale and the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770 and the other built afterwards. Uniquely, of all of the\ntowns, settlements, fortresses, and cities of Middle-earth, Lake-town\nutilized water as its defense. The Long Lake was also surrounded by\ntowering cliffs and high mountains, all helpful natural barriers that\nhad the potential to aid its defenders in a siege (such as the\nEasterling invasion of the North in TA 3018). While these defenses\nslowed and diverted Lake-town's human enemies, it did nothing to prepare\nits inhabitants against Smaug. The villagers would be harassed on a\nregular basis by Smaug. Smaug would steal an occasional maiden or just\nburn down their homes.\n\nLake-town was founded sometime during the Third Age and its inhabitants\ntraded extensively with the Elves of Thranduil's Woodland Realm, the\nDwarves of the Lonely Mountain and the Iron Hills, their kin in Dale and\nDorwinion to the south, and possibly with the Easterlings (in times of\npeace, of course). The Men of Lake-town traded with Dorwinion (a human\nrealm on the fertile coastal plain on the west shore of the Sea of Rhûn)\nin a unique way; wine barrels were floated down from Thranduil's caverns\nin Mirkwood (the Elves were known as copious wine drinkers, as found in\nthe Hobbit) along the Celduin down to Lake-town, where they were\nredirected to Dorwinion. The wine was then paid for and filled with the\nnecessary goods before being shipped back north, and the cycle of trade\nresumed once more. These barrels were also quite large, for they could\nfit a Hobbit or Dwarf (even the extremely fat Bombur).\n\n\n\nIt is also where Bilbo and the Dwarves travelled in their adventure to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain. In the year TA 2941 of the Third Age the\ntown was attacked by the dragon, but Bard the Bowman, who had indirectly\nlearned of a weakness in Smaug's armor that had first been noticed by\nBilbo Baggins, slew the dragon. Smaug, livid\nwith bestial fury, had winged his way to the town in the dead of night\nand promptly began to immolate the wooden matchwood structures there,\nmaterials that burst into flame at the slightest provocation. Its\ninhabitants realized all too late their predicament and while some,\nincluding most of the women and children, got away safely on boats, many\nperished in the maelstrom of fire that ensued. A brave company of\nspearmen and archers attempted, in vain, to shoot down the dragon, but\nwere mostly immolated themselves. It wasn't until Bard managed to kill\nthe dragon, that the destruction finally ended. The town was wrecked by\nthe dragon, but afterwards it was rebuilt using some of the treasure\nthat Smaug had stolen, though the town's Master ran off with some of the\nGold. Part of the town's population followed Bard to resettle the\nKingdom of Dale.\n\nAs trading people, the Men of Lake-town knew the Common Speech, Westron.\nHowever, amongst themselves they spoke an ancient form of it, which was\nloosely related to but distinct from the also ancient language of the\nRohirrim. Tolkien “translated” Westron into English in his text, so to\nrepresent its ancient relative that the Rohirrim spoke he substituted\nOld English. Thus, Tolkien substituted Old Norse for the language of the\nMen of Esgaroth (in person and place names, etc.) because it is an\nancient relative of English that is related to Old English.\n\nAfter the town's near destruction following Smaug's rage, its\ninhabitants rebuilt it with more splendor and grandeur further down the\nlake. LAKE-TOWN is used to refer to the pre-Smaug town upon the Long\nLake, while the rebuilt, larger cousin further down the waterway is\nreferred to as ESGAROTH. The inhabitants also learned a crucially\nimportant, but painful, lesson bought with the blood of loved ones: the\ntown was built to be less susceptible to flame and its military was\nexpanded. These lessons greatly aided it during the War of the Ring.\n",

Two\nother cities were Alqualondë and Tirion, the respective homes of the\nTeleri and the Noldor. It also had an island, Tol Eressëa, just off its\neast coast.\n\nValinor as explained was the home of the Valar, the Powers of\nMiddle-earth. The sea to the west of the island was called Ekkaia, or\nthe Encircling Sea; it surrounded both Valinor and Middle-earth.\n\nEach of the Valar had their own region of the land where they resided\nand altered things to their desire. Yavanna, the Vala of nature, growth,\nand harvest, resided in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the\nisland. Orome, the Vala of the hunt, lived in the Woods of Orome to the\nnorth-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which\nOrome could track and hunt. Nienna, the lonely Vala of sorrow and\nendurance lived cut off in the far west of the island in the Halls of\nNienna where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south\nof the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the\nHalls of Mandos. Mandos, the brother of Nienna, was the Vala of the\nafterlife. All inhabitants of Middle-earth went to the Halls of Mandos\nshould they happen to die, mortals and immortals alike (immortals could\nbe killed although they did not die of old age) although it was said\nthat in death as in life, they were separated. Also living in the Halls\nof Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\n\nTo the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was\nsituated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was\nsituated to the north of the Gardens of Lórien (not to be confused with\nLothlórien in Middle-earth which was created by the same Valar, Lórien\nalso known as Irmo, the Vala of dreams). Este and Lórien being husband\nand wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of\nAule the smith Valar who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay\nthe Mansions of Manwe and Varda, the two most powerful Valar, also\nmarried. To the west of them stood the Trees of Valinor, Telperion and\nLaurelin. The entire great island of Valinor was surrounded on three\nsides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by\na huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme\nnorth-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast\nand treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the fall of\nNúmenor, joined the two continents of Valinor and Middle-earth. In the\nbeginning, the Noldor, tricked by the evil Vala Melkor passed along this\npass to go back to Middle-earth, among those was Galadriel who was\nfeatured in the War of the Ring. Those who took this pass were not\nallowed back to Valinor for many years, but in the end pity was taken on\nthem when Middle-earth began to fade and pass into the age of men and\nthey were allowed to pass back to the Undying Lands of their own accord\nwhen they felt ready to do so.\n\nAlso, for a time after the exile of the Noldor and before the ruin of\nNúmenor, a long chain of small islands called the Enchanted Isles ran\nthe full length of the east coast to the continent. The enchanted\nislands and a bewildering shadow created the Shadowy Seas, which to\nprevent mariner, mortal or immortal, from reaching the land by sea (by\nthe Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated Middle-earth and Valinor.\nUntil the Changing of the World in the center of this sea was the isle\nof Númenor. This defence lasted centuries until Eärendil was guided\nthrough the Shadowy Seas by the light of the Silmaril brought on board\nby his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot, said to be the fairest ship\never fashioned, constructed by Earendil and Cirdan the shipwright.\n\nAfter the destruction of Númenor and the Changing of the World, the\nUndying Lands were no longer a physical part of Arda so that Men could\nno longer sail to Aman or Tol Eressea. Only the Elves could sail there\nby the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres\nof the earth.\n\nBy special permission of the Valar, the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Bilbo\nBaggins, and Samwise Gamgee were also permitted to go to Valinor, and\nLegolas the elf brought with him Gimli the Dwarf.\n",

    "text": "ISENGARD, also known as ANGRENOST ('Iron Fortress') in Sindarin, was one\nof the three Fortresses of Gondor, and held within it one of the realm's\nPalantiri.\n\nHowever, in the latter half of the Third Age, the stronghold came into\nthe possession of Saruman, becoming his personal realm and home until\nhis defeat in the War of the Ring.\n\nDescription\n\nIsengard was built in the Second Age around the tower of Orthanc by the\nNúmenoreans, in exile in the days of their power in Nan Curunir (The\nWizards Vale) in The Misty Mountains. Its location was at the\nnorthwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the\nFords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together with\nthe fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of Rohan.\n\nIsengard was comprised of a circular stone-wall surrounding a broad\nplain, in the center of which was the Tower of Orthanc. Isengard had\nonly one gate, which faced south.\n\nThe river Angren (or Isen) began at Methedras behind Isengard, which\nalso formed its northern wall. The other three sides were guarded by a\nlarge wall, known as the Ring of Isengard, which was only breached by\nthe inflow of the river Angren at the northeast through a portcullis,\nand the gate of Isengard at the south, at both shores of the river. The\nGate was said to be able to open without a sound.\n\nIsengard was, at first, a green and beautiful tower complex, with many\nlarge trees and grass fields, fed by the river until it was dammed by\nSaruman. After the Wizard's defeat, however, Treebeard and the rest of\nthe Ents made it a vivid green area again, after destroying the walls\nand dam, renaming it the “Treegarth of Orthanc”.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the early Third Age, the land of Calenardhon became depopulated,\n\nand the last warden of Orthanc was recalled to Minas Tirith. Isengard\nremained guarded by a small company, led by a hereditary captain, much\nas happened at Aglarond at the time.\n\nAfter Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward of Gondor,\nand became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and the company of\nAglarond removed to the northern fortress, although the rest of Gondor\nalmost forgot about it. The small guard intermarried much with the\nDunlendings, until the place became a Dunlending fortress in all but\nname. Orthanc, however, remained closed, as the Steward of Gondor still\nheld the keys. Isengard soon came all but deserted.\n\nDuring the rule of Rohan's King Déor it turned out that Isengard had\nbecome openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Using Isengard as their base, the\nDunlendings continued to raid Rohan during Déor's son Gram's rule, until\nduring the rule of Gram's son Helm Hammerhand a Dunlending lord, Freca\nand his son Wulf nearly managed to destroy the Rohirrim. The Rohirrim\neventually won, taking Isengard, and guarding it for Gondor.\n\nDuring the time of the Steward of Gondor Beren, Saruman the White\nsuddenly reappeared from the East, and he offered to guard Isengard.\nBeren gladly gave him the keys to Orthanc, and Saruman settled there.\nAfter him the valley became known as _Nan Curunír_, or “Wizard's Vale”.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Isengard was Saruman's base of operations\nagainst the Rohirrim, and he defiled the valley, cutting down its trees\nand grass and replacing them with stone and machinery. He dammed and\ndiverted the Angren, possibly for use as hydropower. Isengard's valley\nwas honeycombed with deep pits, used for breeding orcs and smithying\nweapons. Eventually, an army of Ents and Huorns led by Treebeard of\nFangorn attacked Isengard, wrecking all of Saruman's industries,\nalthough they could not force entry to the Tower of Orthanc.\n\nThe Hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, as the new\n“doorwardens”, received Théoden King of Rohan, Aragorn, and Gandalf at\nthe gates. Saruman was confronted but refused to beg for pardon, and he\nwas released into Treebeard's guard together with his servant Gríma\nWormtongue. Saruman abandoned Isengard after Sauron's defeat, playing\noff Treebeard's hatred of caging any living thing in order to manipulate\nhim into letting him leave. It was planned by Sauron that Isengard would\nbe given to his loyal ambassador, the Mouth of Sauron, after Saruman's\ndemise.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring\n\nEarly in the Fourth Age, Isengard was restored, and Treebeard replanted\nmany trees. Orthanc again became a tower of the Reunited Kingdom of\nAragorn King Elessar.\n\nUnder the Ent dominion, the ringwall was torn down and the Ents planted\nthe Watchwood there and renamed the new forest the TREEGARTH OF ORTHANC.\nSaruman's pits and caverns were filled, and the land was healed. The\nValley was now filled with trees and a small lake was constructed near\nOrthanc. The valley was given to the Ents by Aragorn, to do with it as\nthey wished, granted that they keep watch upon Orthanc and prevent\nanyone without permission to enter it.",

    "text": "DUNLAND was the land of the wild men, or 'Dunlendings'. _Dunland_ means\n_Hill Land_ in the language of neighboring Rohan, whose people named it\nafter arriving in nearby Calenardhon in the later Third Age.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDunland was inhabited by the Dunlendings, Men who were mostly bearded\nand had dirty faces, and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather\nand animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for\ntheir purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at\ntimes they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn\nbuildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in\nwere crude shacks of wood and animal skin that were often sabotaged by\nWargs and sometimes the Rohirrim.\n\nThe vernacular of this land's inhabitants, including possibly the\nStoors, was Dunlendish.\n\nAncestors of the Dunlendings inhabited the forested regions of\nMiddle-earth on either side of the Gwathló in the early Second Age; thus\nthe early Numenoreans called them _Gwaithuirim_. They spoke a language\nrelated to that of the Second House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the\nvastly different Bëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of\nAdûnaic, and this lack of mutual understanding led to outright\nhostility. The Numenoreans greedily harvested _Gwaithuirim_ forests for\ntimber, and after much war and bloodshed, the _Gwaithuirim_ from south\nof the Gwathló fled east to the Hithaeglir while others scattered to the\ncape of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, the land north of the Gwathló and south of\nthe Baranduin was named Minhiriath “Land between the Rivers”, although\nthe land south of Minhiriath remained unnamed. Its inhabitants were\nlargely ignored despite the fact that the Gondor colonial city of\nTharbad grew up on the Gwathló west of the Misty Mountain hillfolk who\nhad been _Gwaithuirim_ long before. It was not until Gondor abandoned\nthis city in TA 2050 that the people and their land were renamed: both\nbecame known as Enedwaith “Middle-Folk, Middle Region”, because they\nowed no allegiance to the North or South Kingdom.\n\nThe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of\nNúmenor (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who\nnevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Dunharrow who\nbetrayed Isildur were descended from _Gwaithurim_.\n\nIn T.A. 2770, Smaug the Dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nDwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from\nwhere Thrór departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed\nto Moria in T.A. 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by\nthe Orcs' brutal slaying of Thrór, Thráin II and Thorin led the remnants\nof their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle\nin the Blue Mountains).\n\nWhen Gondor decided to give the depopulated province of Calenardhon to\nthe numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510, the Hillfolk of the\nHithaeglir felt threatened by these _Forgoil_ “Strawheads” (a demeaning\nreference to the blonde hair of the refugees from Calenardhon). The\nHillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during the dwindling of the\nDúnedain and had already reclaimed all the land between the Adorn and\nIsen. Still, open war was not waged until the reign of Helm Hammerhand\n(TA 2741 - TA 2759). Freca, the Lord of the Hillmen (whom the Rohirrim\nnow called Dunlendings) tried to get the throne of Rohan for himself by\npetitioning for the marriage of his son Wulf to the daughter of Helm.\nThe Hill-men leader Freca was killed and Wulf led the Dunlendings into\nopen war with Rohan. They unsuccessfully besieged the Hornburg during\nthe Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf did take Edoras and killed\nHaleth, the son of Helm, in front of the golden hall of Meduseld.\nNonetheless, Helm's nephew Fréalaf held out against the Dunlendings in\nthe refuge of Dunharrow. He recaptured Edoras at the end of the Long\nWinter and killed Wulf personally. The Dunlendings were driven out of\nRohan, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased Helm Hammerhand.\n\nGuarding the Gap of Rohan was the fortress of Isengard, where a\nhereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the Steward\nof Gondor Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it had\nbecome hostile to Gondor. To remedy this situation, Beren gave Saruman\nthe keys to Orthanc to guard Isengard for Gondor.\n\nSaruman used the historical hostility against outlanders to tempt the\nDunlendings into supporting him during the War of the Ring. In The Two\nTowers extended edition, the Dunlending warlord is shown giving a\nblood-oath to Saruman.\n\nAfter the battle at Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim allowed the surviving\nDunlendings to return to their homes. The Rohirrim required that all\nhostilities cease and that the Dunlendings again retreat behind the\nIsen.\n\n\nNearby locations\n\n-   North: Galanduin River\n-   East: Misty Mountains\n-   South: Isengard\n-   West: Enedwaith\n",

It was there that Thingol\nwas slain by the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod. The quest of Beren to gain\na Silmaril begins at Menegroth. It is also here that Lúthien the fair\nwas born. It was later sacked by the Sons of Fëanor in pursuit of one of\nthe Silmarils taken from Morgoth's Iron Crown prior to the War of Wrath.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n\n\nIn the years after the War for Sake of the Elves, the Teleri were\nscattered all over Beleriand in havens such as Falas or in the woodlands\nat Region and Neldoreth. Their leader Elwë disappeared for a long time\nin the woods with Melian, his beloved. Then, he and Melian reappeared\ncalling himself Thingol, was urged to build a home for his people, so he\nhad the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in the construction of a new\nfortress. It was dug into the western wall of the ravine above the river\nEsgalduin and had only one entrance high above the river accessible by a\nlarge stone bridge. It was named Menegroth or the Thousand Caves because\nof the extensive number of caverns and chambers within all hewn of stone\nand beautifully decorated with carvings of beech trees and birds. These\nwere many different places including armories, treasures, smithies, and\nliving quarters for both the Elves and Dwarves.\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees, Doriath received peace for a long while\nas Thingol preferred isolation and ordered his people not to mingle in\nthe affairs of the Noldor due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the\nQuenyan language was forbidden in his realm. Only with his kin in\nNargothrond did Thingol remain in contact with. He did not take part in\nany of the later Battles of Beleriand relating to the struggle with\nMorgoth.\n\nSometime during mid First Age, Beren Erchamion asked Thingol's\ndaughter, Lúthien, for her hand in marriage, but the King demanded that\nBeren was to go on a quest to retrieve a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron\nCrown. Lúthien accompanied him on the quest to Angband and they\nsucceeded in eventually retrieving the jewel; but the stakes were high.\nCarcharoth, a wolf guarding the Gates of Angband, bit off Beren's hand\nin which he was holding the Silmaril. The wolf ventured to Menegroth,\nravaging the lands in his path, and broke through its boundaries. He was\nconfronted by the brave Huan, the Great Hound of Valinor, on the\nnorth-east banks of Esgalduin and was killed in the brawl. The Silmaril\nwas found in the wolf's stomach, after swallowing it in Beren's hand,\nand was given to King Thingol.\n\nSack of Doriath\n\nYears later, Hurin Thalion brought the famed Nauglamir as a gift to\nThingol. Thingol contemplated a plan to set the Silmaril into the\nNauglamir. He offered a reward to the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod if\nthey succeeded in setting the stone into the Nauglamir. A great desire\nfor the Silmaril possessed the Dwarves and they formed a greed to own\nboth the jewel and the Nauglamir. They finished the work and\nsubsequently claimed the treasure for themselves, slew Thingol, and fled\nMenegroth. \n\nThe news spread fast and the Dwarves were hunted for and then slain. Two\nescaped and and told a tale of lies about their ''betrayal ''and their\nbrethren being _slaughtered_ by the Elves._ _The Dwarves of Nogrod\nformed a great army and rose in anger at the elves and invaded the now\nunguarded Doriath._ _This led to the Battle of the Thousand Caves_ _in\nwhich many were slain on both sides. Mablung, the leader of the guard,\nwas slaughtered at the doors of the treasure chamber where the Nauglamir\nwas held. The Dwarves of Nogrod were then waylaid at Sarn Athrad on\ntheir return by the Laiquendi led by Beren. Their King was slain by\nBeren in single combat and the remainder of their host were felled by\nEnts.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_MENEGROTH_ is a Sindarin word.\n\n\nLay of Leithian\n\n ...through corridors of carven dread whose turns were lit by lanterns\nhung or flames from torches that were flung on dragons hewn in the cold\nstone with jewelled eyes and teeth of bone. Then sudden, deep beneath\nthe earth the silences with silver mirth were shaken and the rocks were\nringing, the birds of Melian were singing; and wide the ways of shadows\nspread as into arched halls she led Beren in wonder. There a light like\nday immortal and like night of stars unclouded, shone and gleamed. A\nvault of topless trees it seemed, whose trunks of carven stone there\nstood like towers of an enchanted wood in magic fast for ever bound,\nbearing a roof whose branches wound in endless tracery of green lit by\nsome leaf-imprisoned sheen of moon and sun, and wrought of gems, and\neach leaf hung on golden stems. Lo! there amid immortal flowers the\nnightingales in shining bowers sang o'er the head of Melian, while water\nfor ever dripped and ran from fountains in the rocky floor. There\nThingol sat. His crown he wore of green and silver, and round his chair\na host in gleaming armour fair...\n\n    ―_Lay of Leithian, lines 981-1011_",

    "text": "The BLUE MOUNTAINS or ERED LUIN, also known as ERED LINDON, was a\nmountain range situated in the far west of Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Arda\n\nThe Blue Mountains arose sometime after the tumultuous chaos caused by\nMelkor's destruction of the Two Lamps that destroyed the perfect\nsymmetry of Arda. In these early days, the Blue Mountains were located\nbetween the newly formed great sea of Belegaer and the newly formed Sea\nof Helcar. The Blue Mountains were connected to the Iron Mountains to\nthe north and the Red Mountains in the east which formed one great\nmountain range chain known by different names. The Ancient Grey\nMountains were to its south separated by a great gap.\n\nEldar Days\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the Sleep of Yavanna, the Blue\nMountains was an unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven\nrivers arose in it on the western side, and the land these rivers flowed\nthrough was known as Ossiriand, which was later also known as Lindon,\ntherefore the mountains were sometimes referred to as the Ered Lindon.\nDwarven kinfolk either awoke here or migrated here from other awakening\npoints and delved the cities of Belegost and Nogrod and made contact and\nalliance with the Sindar of Thingol.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe mountain range was broken during the war of the Valar against\nMorgoth, and at the middle of the range the sea broke through, creating\na great gap where was set the Gulf of Lune a new terminus for the river\nLune. In the middle of the gap, where the Lune met the sea, the Grey\nHavens of Mithlond of the Elven Kingdom of Lindon were built. When seen\nas the border of Lindon the Ered Luin were called Ered Lindon.\n\n\n\nThird Age and beyond\n\nDuring the Third Age, its forests, besides that of Mirkwood, were the\nlargest in Middle-earth. In the latter part of the Third Age, the\nDwarves settled the Blue Mountains again when Thráin II and his son\nThorin and the Dwarven survivors of the Sack of Erebor moved from\nDunland and delved a prosperous settlement there. After the War of\nthe Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Elves continued to travel west to\nLindon through the gap in the mountains by way of the Gulf of Lune,\nwhere they eventually intended to set sail on the Straight Road to the\nUndying Lands of Aman. After the War of the Ring it is said that many\nDwarves from the east migrated back to their ancient homeland and Ered\nLuin was a prosperous kingdom oncemore.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDwarves\n\nThe Blue Mountains, the Iron Hills, and Lonely Mountain were the main\nareas of Dwarf colonization by the late Third Age. During the 4000+\nyears following the cataclysmic sundering and catastrophic downfall of\nBeleriand, when the mighty Dwarf fortress-cities of Nogrod and Belegost\nwere inundated by the sea, it is possible that the Dwarves rebuilt those\ncities to their former splendor.\n\n\n\nThe Dwarves would have plundered the mines of the Blue Mountains for the\nhoard of resources it held within the depths of darkness at its roots. \n\nBefore setting off in their quest to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin\nOakenshield and his twelve other companions (as well as other Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain) resided here in the Blue Mountains after being\nrendered homeless by the Dragon Smaug.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, many Dwarves from the eastern kingdoms\nmigrated back to the Blue Mountains. Their population grew and the Blue\nMountains became a prosperous kingdom once again.\n\nElves\n\nIt is shown in several maps made of Middle-earth that vast ancient\nforests flanked both sides of the Blue Mountains, even after the\ngargantuan slaughter of Eriador's great forests by the men of Númenor\nand their incessant appetite for lumber. These forests, alongside the\nfertile coastal plain, would prove to be hotspots for Elven migration\nand inhabitation.\n\n\n\nIt is stated at the very beginning of _The Hobbit_ that the High Elves\nlived within the vales and forests of the Blue Mountains, presumably\nsharing the land with the Dwarves. To this number would be added Sindar,\nWood-elves, and maybe even a few Avari.\n\nThe influx of new Elven settlers soared after the end of the First Age\nwho lived under the Ñoldor High King Gil-galad in the Second Age.\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad in the Third Age, the foot of the Blue\nMountains became part of Lindon where Elves lived temporarily until they\nleft for the Undying Lands, due to the Elves desiring to escape the woes\nand predicaments of Middle-earth.\n\n\nGeology\n\nAlthough the Blue Mountains were little described (owing to their\nlocation on the fringes of all of Tolkien's tales), we can assume a bit\nof their geology. The outer layers of the mountains seem to have been\nunderlaid by metamorphic rocks formed in contact with numerous igneous\nintrusions. This environment is often necessary to produce veins of ore\nsuch as those mined by the Dwarves from the beginning of time. This\nenvironment produced the trove of Gold, Silver, Iron, Gems, and other\nmaterials that made the Dwarf kingdoms incredibly wealthy.\n\nThe Blue mountains were shorter than the Misty Mountains, and not as\nhigh; their altitude was probably around 3000-4000 meters, on average.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin name for the mountains, _ERED LUIN_ is translated as the\nwords _ered_ ('Mountains') and _luin_ ('Blue'). \n",

    "text": "The MISTY MOUNTAINS, also named the _HITHAEGLIR_ , was a mountain range that\nran 1280 kilometres (795.35 miles) from north to south between Eriador\nand the valley of the Great River, Anduin, and from Mount Gundabad in\nthe far north to Methedras in the south.\n\nAn early version of this range's name was _ERED HITHUI_ .\n\n\nGeographical description\n\n\n\nThe range's notable peaks were Caradhras, Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Mount\nGundabad, and Methedras.\n\nLocation\n\nThe northernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Mount Gundabad; where\naccording to legend Durin (eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves)\nawoke, though it became an abode and mountain-fortress of Orcs.\n\nThe greatest Dwarven realm in Middle-Earth, Khazad-dûm (later named\nMoria), was located at the midpoint of the Misty Mountains. The three\npeaks that were part of Khazad-dûm were Caradhras (Redhorn), Celebdil\n(Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Inside Celebdil, the Dwarves\nbuilt the Endless Stair, from the foundations of the mountain to the top\nof it. The southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Methedras,\nmeaning “the Last Peak”.\n\nRoutes through the Misty Mountains\n\nThe most important passes were the High Pass and the Redhorn Pass. There\nwas also a pass at the source of the Gladden river.\n\nRoutes around the Misty Mountains\n\nThe Gap of Rohan was the valley (probably of the River Isen) between the\nsouthernmost peaks of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the\nWhite Mountains. There may have been a gap between Mount Gundabad in the\nMisty Mountains and the westernmost extremity of the Grey Mountains,\nthough published maps differ on this point. \n\nInhabitants\n\nUnder the Misty Mountains were the former Dwarf realm of Khazad-dum, and\nthe “Goblin-town” in which Bilbo Baggins stumbled across the One Ring,\nwhich had been in the possession of the creature Gollum, who also dwelt\nthere himself on the eastern side. Rivendell was hidden in the foothills\nof the Misty Mountains at the western end of the High Pass.\n\nCarn Dûm, where the Witch-King of Angmar resided for several centuries\nin the Third Age, lay between a western spur of the northern extreme of\nthe range, known as the Mountains of Angmar. Mount Gundabad, the largest\nGoblin dwelling in the Misty Mountains, was located south-east of\nAngmar.\n\nIsengard lay centered around the Tower of Orthanc in Nan Curunír, the\nvalley between the arms of Methedras, which was the southernmost peak of\nthe Misty Mountains. The “stone-giants” also inhabited this mountain\nrange, as told in _The Hobbit_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Misty Mountains were created by Melkor during the Time of the Trees,\nwho wanted to make it difficult for Oromë, who often rode across\nMiddle-earth hunting his fell beasts, to pass.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin awoke under Mount Gundabad and later established\nthe caves of Khazad-dûm. Later, when the Elves on their Great Journey to\nValinor looked upon their terrible height a portion of the Teleri, later\nknown as the Nandor grew afraid and turned south down the Great River.\nThousands of years later, the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth and\nestablished great realms in the Beleriand and in the highlands, but they\nnever crossed the mountains or established realms within them.\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nOver three-hundred years into the First Age, the tribes of Men crossed\nthe Misty Mountains and began migrating into the Beleriand, first the\nEdain and then later the Easterlings or Swarthy Men. After the defeat of\nMorgoth, the surviving orcs and a Balrog came to live there and would\nremain a problem for over six-thousand years. The Easterling men who\nfought with Morgoth crossed the mountains and began living east of the\nWilderland in Rhûn. The Great Eagles also began living here in a place\nknown as the Eagles Eyrie.\n\nThe great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm beneath the Misty Mountains\nthrived as good relations with the Ñoldor of Eregion were established,\nuntil Sauron invaded Eriador from Mordor and the east destroying Eregion\nand ravaging the lands beyond. The dwarves survived by shutting\nthemselves in Khazad-dûm behind the Doors of Durin.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn TA 1980, the great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm came to an end when\nthe Dwarves unearthed a Balrog which led to its desertion by TA 1981,\nafter which it was known as Moria (literally, “black chasm”). Slowly,\nthe Misty Mountains became increasingly perilous and dangerous to\ntravelers as Goblins and other creatures came to dwell under there.\n\nAlmost a thousand years later, the thirteen Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo\nBaggins used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains during the Quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain, and were captured by Goblins whilst crossing.\nUnder the mountains, the Great Goblin was slain, and Bilbo found the One\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring tried to cross the Redhorn Pass (after\nrejecting the High Pass leading to Rhovanion as being watched by the\nEnemy, and the Gap of Rohan as taking the Fellowship too close to\nIsengard), but a blizzard forced it to go under the mountain instead of\nover it. They faced a Balrog that dwelt in the deserted realm of\nKhazad-dûm. Gandalf slew the Balrog by casting it down from Zirakzigil,\nbut it had worn his life already, and on that high ground he lay until\nGwaihir bore him to Lothlorien.",

    "text": "MINAS MORGUL (meaning “Tower of Dark sorcery”) was a City/Fortress\nof Gondor, originally called MINAS ITHIL (“Tower of the Rising Moon”).\nAs the easternmost fortification in the kingdom of Gondor, and a sister\ncity to Minas Anor (now known as Minas Tirith), Minas Ithil safeguarded\nthe eastern borders of the Kingdom of Gondor and protected the capital\nOsgiliath from the forces of Mordor during the early part of the Third\nAge. As Gondor's armies weakened, it was then taken by the forces of\nMordor, and used as a base to attack Gondor and in the process, decayed\ninto the dark and demonic fortress that gave the city its new name.\n\nMinas Morgul was located in an upland valley at the feet of the\nMountains of Shadow. It overlooked the region of Ithilien and controlled\nthe only easily accessible pass through the mountains that led into\nMordor, the pass of Cirith Ungol.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinas Ithil\n\n[Minas Morgul located on this map]\n\nMinas Ithil was founded in the Second Age by the Númenorean, Isildur as\na fortress city to defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. Isildur made his\nhome in Minas Ithil, while Isildur's young brother Anárion dwelled\nacross the Anduin in Minas Anor. In front of his house, Isildur planted\na sapling of the White Tree, which he had rescued from the Downfall of\nNúmenor, and in the tower was kept one of the Palantíri called the\nIthil-stone.\n\nIn its heyday, Minas Ithil was described as a beautiful sight, with\nmoonlight filling its inner courts with silver light and causing its\nwalls to gleam silver and white. It was a walled city of white marble\nbuilt on a high shelf of rock. Within the walls, there were white houses\nand a tall tower. The walls and the tower had many windows, and the top\nof the tower revolved slowly back and forth. A road ran from Osgiliath\non the Anduin through Ithilien to the city and crossed the Mountains of\nShadow into Mordor via the pass.\n\nIn SA 3428, Sauron sent a huge army to Minas Ithil and after about a\nyear of siege, it was captured and the White Tree was burned (Isildur\nrecovered a sapling and planted it in Minas Anor in TA 2). However,\nin SA 3430, Anárion recaptured the city, preventing Minas Ithil from\nbeing turned into an early Minas Morgul.\n\nAfter Sauron was defeated in the War of the Last Alliance in SA 3441, a\nwatch was kept from Minas Ithil to prevent the return of evil to Mordor.\n\n[The Witch-King in his throne of Angmar.]\n\nThe Nazgûl, led by the Witch-king of Angmar, the most fearsome of\nSauron's minions, returned to Mordor in 1980 to prepare for Sauron's\nreturn. Meanwhile, Gondor had been devastated by many attacks of\nMordor's allies, the Wainriders, Variags, and Haradrim, who gained two\ndevastating victories, killed two kings, and conquered almost all the\nprovinces east of the Anduin. Soon Mordor started to attack and conquer\nparts of Gondor. In TA 2000, the forces of the nine Nazgûl laid siege to\nMinas Ithil. In TA 2002 after a long siege, the city fell and was\ntransformed into a bastion of evil. As a result, it came to be called\nMinas Morgul, which in Sindarin means _Tower of Dark Sorcery_. Minas\nMorgul stood upon the Morgulduin, a polluted tributary of the Anduin.\n\nThe Palantír's (Ithil-stone's) fate was unknown. Many Men of Gondor\nbelieved the guards of the city had destroyed it, but by the nature of\nthe Palantíri, this was impossible. Others believed that it was taken to\nBarad-dûr, which became known as the real seat of power in Mordor.\n\nMinas Morgul\n\n[The Witch-king's true look, as seen in the _The Fellowship of the Ring_\nfilm]\n\nTerror and war were directed at Gondor from Minas Morgul until Ithilien\nwas deserted. During the War of the Ring, the army that attacked\nOsgiliath and undertook the Siege of Gondor came from Minas Morgul.\n\nIn fashion Minas Morgul seems to have been much like Minas Tirith, only\ncorrupted. The topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, and the\nwalls were illuminated by a pale luminous glow. Under a white bridge\nflowed the foulest river in Middle-earth, the Morgulduin.\n\nThe city had a strange watchfulness about it, and intruders to Morgul\nVale were always noted. Most who approached the city could not stand to\nset eyes on it, and felt that they were being watched.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Aragorn and Gandalf break the bridge and set\nthe fields by it on fire to keep the Minas Morgul troops from the\nCrossroads.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, King Elessar (Aragorn) counseled Faramir to\nmake his abode in the Emyn Arnen southeast of Minas Tirith, in Ithilien,\nand decreed that Minas Ithil in the Morgul Vale, despoiled by its years\nas Minas Morgul, be completely destroyed, for although it might in time\ncome to be made clean, no man might dwell there for many long years.\nEventually, the city was rebuilt as Minas Ithil and the evil that\ntainted the land was at last gone.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _MINAS MORGUL_ is comprised of the Sindarin terms _minas_\n(“tower”) and _morgul_ (“sorcery”). _Morgul_ can also mean “black\nsorcery”, from _mor_ (“black”).\n\nIts previous name, MINAS ITHIL, means “Tower of the Rising Moon”, from\nthe Vanyarin _isil_, meaning moon, or the Sindarin _ithil_.\n\n\nRulers of Minas Morgul\n\n-   WITCH-KING OF MORGUL: Better known as the Witch-king of Angmar, was\n    the leader of the Nazgûl and the principal ruler of Minas Morgul.",

    "text": "ITHILIEN was a region and fiefdom of Gondor bordering Mordor in eastern\nMiddle-earth.\n\nIthilien, or MOON-LAND, was the easternmost province of Gondor, the only\npart of Gondor across the Great River Anduin lying between the river and\nthe Ephel Dúath, subdivided by the stream of Morgulduin into North and\nSouth Ithilien.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was a fair and prosperous land during the Second Age and the first\npart of the Third Age, filled with many woods and gardens, when Gondor\nwas strong and Mordor deserted. Of old its chief city was _Minas Ithil_,\nbut when this was captured by Mordor in TA 2002 it was renamed Minas\nMorgul. After this ,the population gradually migrated across the Anduin\nto escape the looming threat of Ringwraiths from Minas Morgul.\n\nIthilien was reoccupied by hardy folk during the Watchful Peace, but in\nTA 2475 the Watchful Peace was broken when Uruks from Mordor devastated\nthe province; and although they were driven back to the Morgul Vale by\nBoromir I, raids never entirely ceased after this time. Several\ncenturies later attacks by Orcs and Haradrim continue and in TA 2901 the\nraids grew so severe that the remainder of the population of Ithilien\nfled across Anduin and Gondor withdrew from the province, and after the\nreturn of Sauron to Mordor the land was finally abandoned. However the\nStewards of Gondor still kept scouts in Ithilien, based on secret\nlocations such as _Henneth Annûn_, which were built shortly after\n2901. In TA 2954 Mount Doom burst into flame and those few farmers\nwho remained fled Westward over Anduin, leaving only the Rangers behind\nto harry the servants of Sauron.\n\n[Haradrim soldiers march through Ithilien during the War of the Ring.]\n\nIn the narrative of _The Lord of the Rings_, Gollum leads Frodo Baggins\nand Samwise Gamgee through Ithilien on the way to the pass of Cirith\nUngol into Mordor. The land is described in the text as “a fair country\nof climbing woods and swift-falling streams”, with gentle slopes,\n“shielded from the east by the Ephel Dúath and yet not under the\nmountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open to the\nsouthern airs and the moist winds from the Sea”. It is also stated that\n“a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs” and a vast array of tree\nspecies grew in Ithilien, some of them having been planted by men in\ndays of peace, and that despite desolation the land “kept still a\ndishevelled dryad loveliness”. After witnessing a battle with\nSouthrons of Harad accompanied by Mumakil, the hobbits are found by the\nRangers of Ithilien, under the command of Faramir, the son of the\nSteward Denethor II, but are allowed to continue when he is satisfied\nthey are not agents of Sauron.\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring, King Elessar granted to Faramir\nthe Princedom of Ithilien and the Lordship of Emyn Arnen (Faramir also\nmaintained the Office of the Steward, even after he tried to surrender\nit to King Elessar). Emyn Arnen, being the ancestral home of the\nStewards of Gondor, became the official home of the Steward Faramir and\nhis descendants.\n\nDuring the Fourth Age, the region was ruled by the Princes of Ithilien,\na line that started with Faramir and Éowyn (the White Lady of Ithilien).\nMinas Ithil maybe repopulated after Faramir cleaned the evil-remnants in\nMorgul Vale, and Faramir ruled as Lord of Emyn Arnen. A colony was\nsettled in Ithilien by the Elves of Mirkwood and former residents of\nElven kingdoms in the north, welcomed there by Legolas, and “it became\nonce again the fairest country in all the westlands”, until after\nsome time all Elves had departed over the Sea. The colony only lasted\nfor about a century, because many Elves left for Valinor after Elessar's\ndeath in FO 120\n\n\nPlaces\n\nHenneth Annûn\n\n\n\nHENNETH ANNÛN was a hidden outpost of Gondor in North Ithilien, founded\n(like all of Gondor's hidden refuges in Ithilien) by the command of\nSteward Túrin II shortly after Ithilien was made desolate by the\nincursions of Orcs of Mordor around TA 2901 and maintained the\nlongest of such refuges. Henneth Annûn was the longest-lasting of all\nthe refuges of Ithilien.\n\nThis secret refuge (the name means _Window of the Sunset_ in Sindarin)\nconsisted of a cave behind a west-facing waterfall overlooking a pool,\nthe “Window-curtain” stated to have been the “fairest of the falls of\nIthilien.” The cave had been excavated by the stream feeding the\nwaterfall, which originally fell from the hole in the cliff constituting\nthe window in the name, but that stream had since been diverted by the\nMen of Gondor to fall from doubled height, and the tunnel had been\nsealed, except for a concealed entrance along the brink of a deep pool\nbeneath the waterfall.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Faramir son of Steward Denethor II had his\nbase of operations there, and Frodo Baggins and his companion Samwise\nGamgee were taken there by his company.\n\nEmyn Arnen\n\nEMYN ARNEN is a series of hills at the centre of Ithilien, south of\nOsgiliath, standing opposite to Minas Tirith across Anduin and around\nwhich the river made a bend. Emyn Arnen means “Hills Beside the Water”\nin Sindarin, referring to its proximity to the Great River, Anduin.\n\nFrom this place originated the line of later Stewards of Gondor. It was\nhome to a family of Númenórean nobles, and from them came Húrin, chosen\nby King Minardil of Gondor to be his Steward. Later Kings of Gondor only\nchose their stewards from among Húrin's descendants, and eventually the\nStewardship of Gondor became hereditary (the stewards named themselves\nmembers of the House of Húrin).\n\nAfter the War of the Ring the Lordship of the hills was granted to\nFaramir, Prince of Ithilien and Steward to the King Elessar. The element\n_arnen_ in the name was stated by Tolkien to have been of\npre-Númenórean origin, while _emyn_ is a Sindarin word for “hills”.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ITHILIEN_ is a Sindarin word that means 'Moon-land'.",

    "text": "For the latter half of the Third Age, the LONELY MOUNTAIN was the\ngreatest city in Middle-earth.\n\nIt was located in northeast of Rhovanion, and was the source of the\nRiver Running.\n\nThe mountain was named “EREBOR” in Sindarin.\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees and First Age\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin's Folk discovered mineral wealth of the Lonely\nMountain sometime after the awakening of the first Durin. A mining\ncolony was soon set up and a road was laid out to connect the Dwarves to\ntheir great cities from the Iron Hills and as far west as their realms\nand possessions in the Blue Mountains.\n\nSecond and Third Ages\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nThe Dwarves have lived and mined in the mountain during the Second Age,\nbut it wasn't until the mid-Third Age that the colony had become a\nfirmly established Kingdom of the Longbeards, after the fall of the\nancient Kingdom of Khazad-dûm due to the awakening of a Balrog (who was\nlater known as Durin's Bane) in TA 1981. The survivors under Thráin I\nfollowed him to the Lonely Mountain and the colony became the ancestral\nhome of the King under the Mountain. By TA 1999, it had become a Dwarven\nstronghold, where the Dwarves became a numerous and prosperous people.\nIn this time, the Dwarves became very rich and amassed a large amount of\ngold and treasure which included the jewel known as the Arkenstone.\nThrain I used the Arkenstone as a symbol of his rule, and his sons and\ngrandsons under him who were to follow.\n\nFor two-hundred and eleven years the kingdom advanced, expanded,\nprospered, and endured until Thorin I abandoned it to join his kin in\nthe Grey Mountains, and the Lonely Mountain was abandoned for\nthree-hundred and eighty years. However, the Dwarves of the Grey\nMountains began experiencing attacks by the dragons that still lived in\nthose mountains, and became embroiled in a costly war against them,\nforcing the Dwarves to abandon the Grey Mountains in TA 2590. The\nDwarves went their separate ways with Grór and his followers settling in\nthe Iron Hills and Thrór and his followers settling in the Lonely\nMountain.\n\nUnder Siege\n\nWhile Thorin Oakenshield was out hunting one day in TA 2770, Smaug came\nfrom the mountains and invaded the Lonely Mountain, hoarding all its\nwealth for himself. Thráin II and several companions escaped by a secret\ndoor. For many years thereafter the Dwarves lived in exile in the Blue\nMountains until, by a seemingly chance meeting, Gandalf the Grey met\nThorin Oakenshield and together they planned to reclaim the mountain.\nThis is told in detail in _The Quest of Erebor_ and described by\nTolkien's song, “Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold”.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\nIn TA 2941, Bilbo Baggins and Thorin's company traveled to the Lonely\nMountain to regain the treasure Smaug had stolen. Set into the side of\nthe mountain was a secret door, five feet high and wide enough for three\nto walk through abreast. Gandalf had managed to obtain the door's key,\nwhich fit a key hole which could be found only when the setting sun and\nthe last moon of autumn (also known as Durin's Day) were in the sky\nwould the light shine upon the keyhole. As told by Tolkien in The\nHobbit, it took many days to find the door, and luckily for Thorin and\nCompany they did not arrive on Durin's day so they had plenty of time to\nenter the mountain.\n\nSmaug was eventually slain, shot out of the sky by a well-aimed arrow to\nhis only weak spot by Bard the Bowman, a man of Laketown,he was a\ndescendant of the king of Dale Girion, who later became king of the Men\nin the area known as Dale adjoining the Lonely Mountain. Thorin thus\nreclaimed the mountain, but the Elves of Mirkwood and Men of Lake-town\nclaimed a part of the treasure, which Thorin refused to share. Dáin II\nIronfoot came to the aid of his cousin Thorin, and the three Free\nPeoples almost did battle with one another, but then Orcs attacked and\nthe Dwarves, elves, and men joined ranks together with the eagles\nagainst the Orcs, in what became known as the Battle of the Five Armies.\nDuring the battle Thorin was mortally injured, and the titles King under\nthe Mountain and King of Durin's Folk passed to Dáin.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nBattle of Dale\n\nThe demise of Smaug was not\n\nto be the last of Lonely Mountain's many troubles. In TA 3019 on the\n17th of March, a horde of Easterling soldiers from Rhûn swarmed over the\nRedwater river, opening up a second front in the northern theater of the\nWar of the Ring. The sheer force of the feared and renowned Easterlings\ncrushed the Men of Dale and routed their forces, which had to rally back\nto the protection of the Lonely Mountain. The Dwarves and Men fought a\npitched battle against the invaders, in which King Dain and The king of\nDale at the time were killed, eventually emerging victorious over their\nopponents. The impenetrable gates and walls of the Lonely Mountain,\nfurnished and extensively worked with advanced, complex and intricate\nDwarven stonework, defense planning and smith-work, easily withstood the\nsiege equipment of the Easterlings. The Lonely Mountain itself was a key\nstrong-point and gave its defenders great tactical leverage against the\nattackers, being able to shoot arrows and fling stones down below in\nreprisal. The many years invested in improving the Lonely Mountain's\ndefences had paid off, and the defenders outlasted the Easterlings in\nthe siege. The Easterlings then withdrew, suffering disproportionate\ncasualties because of their botched campaign and their difficulty in\ncombating the Dwarven technology, weapons, armor and defenses.\n\nFourth Age\n\nThe Lonely Mountain was a site of battle during the War of the Ring.\nDáin was killed during the War of the Ring, and was succeeded by his son\nThorin III Stonehelm, who ruled well into the Fourth Age. During this\ntime, Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain helped rebuild cities in Gondor\nand the fortress of Helm's Deep, and some went to the newly established\nDwarven colony in the Glittering Caves where Gimli was lord.",

    "lotr_page_id": "240",
    "text": "MINAS TIRITH  (IPA:\n) was the capital of Gondor in the Third Age and the Fourth Age of\nMiddle-earth. Originally known as MINAS ANOR, the “Tower of the Setting\nSun”, it replaced the city Osgiliath as the new capital and stockade of\nGondor.\n\nWhen the Enemy began to take shape again, Minas Anor was renamed Minas\nTirith, the “Tower of Guard.” The city was also called THE WHITE CITY,\nas the courtyard in the front of the city's Citadel contained the White\nTree. Many important events took place in and in front of the city, such\nas the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the healing of Éowyn by Aragorn\nafter the battle, and the coronation of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nLayout\n\nMinas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a large ringwall\nencircling the city and the Pelennor Fields. This wall was built after\nMinas Ithil fell and was renamed Minas Morgul. It was repaired by\nEcthelion II during the time of the War of the Ring, but it had not the\nstrength to defend the city from the Dark Lord Sauron's legions of\nUruk-hai from Mordor. The city itself lay on a hill beneath Mount\nMindolluin, which rose above the city's citadel, by a length of a couple\nof thousand feet. Mount Mindolluin was where Aragorn found the seedling\nof the White Tree. \n\nThe city was divided into seven one-hundred-foot high levels, each\nsurrounded by white walls, except the first walls which had the same\nkind of black stone as Orthanc as a face. The gates connecting the\nlevels did not lay behind one another in a line, but faced in different\ndirections. A spur of rock, whose summit was level with the city's\nuppermost tier, jutted out from the front of the city in an easterly\ndirection, dividing all but the first level into two. Each level was\nscattered with many alleys, narrow passageways, and full-fledged houses\n(which were probably quite rare in the city). On the sixth level were\nlocated the Houses of Healing, surrounded by pleasant gardens. Finally,\nwithin the seventh wall, was the Citadel of Minas Tirith, with the White\nTower of Ecthelion - three hundred feet high, so that its apex was one\nthousand feet above the plain.\n\nLevels\n\n\n\nThe First Level of Minas Tirith was the lowest level of Minas Tirith\nwhere was the Main gate.\n\nDuring the Siege of Minas Tirith, Uruk-hai cast fire into the First\nLevel, burning many buildings and causing general havoc to many of the\ndefenders. Later on, the Main Gate was breached when Grond was finally\nused against it, and the soldiers of Gondor and Uruk-hai clashed in the\nstreets of the First Circle but Aragorn ordered a retreat and then made\ntheir way up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinas Tirith (as Minas Anor) was built in SA 3320. King Ostoher rebuilt\nthe city in TA 420, and, gradually, it became more important than\nOsgiliath, the original capital, which in later years fell into ruin.\nKing Tarondor finally moved the King's House to the city in TA 1640,\nthereby making it the official capital of the kingdom of Gondor. In the\nyear TA 2002, the White City's companion tower Minas Ithil (the “Tower\nof the Moon”) on the borders of Mordor was captured by the Ringwraiths\nand renamed Minas Morgul (the “Tower of Sorcery”). Minas Anor was then\nrenamed Minas Tirith, meaning the “Tower of Guard”, to indicate that,\nsince the fall of Minas Ithil, Minas Tirith was the only thing that\ndefended Gondor and all the other lands around and behind it against the\ndarkness from Mordor. The Rammas Echor, the great wall encircling the\nrich farmlands and suburbs of the City, was built at this time.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMinas Tirith only has Gondorian soldiers while the civilians dwell in\nOsgiliath with several Gondorian soldiers. After the Uruk-hai attacked\nand overran Osgiliath a thousand soldiers were killed while the\nremaining thousand soldiers fled to Minas Tirith while the civilians\nwere evacuated to Rohan. The remaining gondorian soldiers entered\nOsgiliath and once the uruk-hai were slain the civilians departed from\nRohan and returned to Osgiliath.\n\nSiege of Minas Tirith\n\nMinas Tirith was besieged by the armies of Mordor, under the Great\nDarkness generated by Sauron's power. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\ntook place on March 15, 3019 in the fields surrounding the city. It was\na very large battle. Theoden, the King of Rohan was killed during this\nbattle by the Witch-king of Angmar. At about the same time, the\nWitch-king was destroyed by Éowyn, lady of Rohan, who was severely\nwounded in the process. It was also there that Gandalf took command of\nthe City's defenses from the Ruling Steward Denethor after he fell to\ndespair. Aragorn later arrived at the hour of need with Gondor's Army of\nthe South which he had liberated from defending the port city of\nPelargir, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Free Peoples. After\nthe battle, the stench of death was heavy in Minas Tirith's air, and the\nPelennor Fields lay strewn with bodies.\n\nFourth Age\n\nOn 1 May 3019, the Crowning of King Elessar took place on the plain\noutside Minas Tirith. After his coronation, he entered the city as the\nKing of Gondor, as he was destined to become from the start of his\nlifetime. With his coronation, King Elessar refounded the line of the\nKings of Gondor, and as he was also the King of the Kingdom of Arnor,\nMinas Tirith became Capital of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nMinas Tirith was repaired by its new king (who grew plants inside of its\nwalls to add to its luster and beauty) and by the Dwarves of Glittering\nCaves, particularly Gimli, who built a new gate for the city (made of\nmithril and steel) and altogether fixed the layout of the city as well.\nMinas Tirith was said to have been made even more beautiful than when it\nwas at the time of its founding. The city is known to have stood firm\nand strong well into the Fourth Age because of these two renovations.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, as Of The Ring Of Power And The Third Age says,\nafter War of the Ring, the city is referred to as Minas Anor again after\nthe overthrow of Sauron and the destruction of Barad-dûr.\n",

    "text": "THE SHIRE is subdivided into several regions.\n\n\nFarthings\n\nThe original parts of the Shire were subdivided into four FARTHINGS\n(“fourth-ings” or “quarterings”): the Three-Farthing stone marked the\npoint where the borders of the Eastfarthing, Westfarthing and\nSouthfarthing of the Shire came together, by the Great East Road.\n\nThe Northfarthing\n\nThe Northfarthing is the least populated part of the Shire. This was the\nsite of the historic Battle of Greenfields.\n\n-   LONG CLEEVE was the home of the small part of the Took clan known as\n    the _North-Tooks_, descendants of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, who\n    settled here after the Battle of Greenfields.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The village of HARDBOTTLE was the home to the Bracegirdle family of\n    Hobbits, to whom Lobelia Sackville-Baggins belonged. Some maps\n    erroneously place Hardbottle in the Southfarthing.\n\nThe Westfarthing\n\nThe western and most populated part of the Shire, this is the site of\nthe towns Michel Delving, Tuckborough (part of Took-land), and Hobbiton.\n\n-   MICHEL DELVING is the chief town of the Shire, located in the White\n    Downs. Its name means simply “large excavation”.\n\n        The Mayor of Michel Delving is the only elected official of The\n        Shire, elected on a seven year term.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   HOBBITON is the village where Bag End is located. This is the home\n    of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins and the site of the beginning and\n    conclusion of the novels _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.\n    Sam Gamgee and his grandfather, the “Gaffer”, live on the lane of\n    _Bagshot Row_, below Bag End.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Bywater is a village a short walk east of Hobbiton. It is best known\n    as the home of two inns, The Green Dragon Inn and The Ivy Bush.\n\nThe Southfarthing\n\nA rural and fertile area, the Southfarthing is the site of the towns\nGamwich (original home of the Gamgee family), Cotton, Longbottom and\nmuch pipe-weed production.\n\n-   LONGBOTTOM, a name meaning “long valley”, was founded by Tobold\n    Hornblower with the introduction of pipe-weed, in TA 2670, allowing\n    the region to become well established due to the success of the\n    pipe-weed industry.\n\nThe Eastfarthing\n\nBorders on Buckland, contains the towns Frogmorton and Whitfurrows and\nthe farms of the Marish. Originally, the Eastfarthing was under the\ncontrol of the Oldbuck family. Even after these became the Brandybucks,\nthe farmers of the Eastfarthing followed the Brandybucks rather than the\nThain and Mayor.\n\n-   THE YALE is the name of the low-lying lands of the Shire's\n    Eastfarthing that lay along the northern side of the long road from\n    Stock westwards to Tuckborough. This seems to have been a sparsely\n    populated area, and in fact the map of the Shire in _The Lord of the\n    Rings_ marks only a single building here.\n    -   The meaning of the Yale's name is obscure. The well-known\n        English personal and placename “Yale” has its origins in a Welsh\n        expression meaning “fertile upland.” Its use may suggest that\n        the Hobbits who named it had contacts with “strange” languages,\n        possibly those of Dunland.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   THE MARISH is the name of fertile, yet boggy farmlands located in\n    the Shire's Eastfarthing. It is where the Oldbuck family is believed\n    to have lived before Gorhendad Oldbuck removed the family across the\n    Brandywine to Buckland and changed their name\n\n\nOther parts of the Shire\n\nThe Buckland and Westmarch are sometimes reckoned part of the Shire,\nthough they are not part of any Farthing. Buckland was described in\nChapter V _A conspiracy unmasked_ in Fellowship of the Ring as being\n_“virtually a small independent country.. a sort of colony of the\nShire.”_ Westmarch became part of the Shire only after the end of the\nevents portrayed in Lord of the Rings, in the fourth age.\n\nBuckland\n\nLocation, villages and borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) river. The\nhobbits living in Buckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect\nthemselves against evil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders\nBuckland to the east. Buckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate,\nthe only entrance to Buckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south\nthe borders of Buckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins\nthe Baranduin near the village of Haysend. The most important town of\nBuckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where the Brandy Hall is located, home of the\nMaster of Buckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandywine River from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nsouth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin crossed using the Ferry just before the arrival of a Black\nRider, who was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge as there\nwere no boats kept on the western bank of the river.\n\nHistory and Culture\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 by Gorhenhad Oldbuck, the ancestor\nof Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first Master\nof Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his family's\nname.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Baranduin it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland and the Westmarch officially a part of the Shire.\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats.\n\nThe Westmarch\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring at the start of the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth, King Aragorn Elessar granted the Hobbits of the Shire\neffective self-rule inside his Reunited Kingdom, banning any men from\nentering the land.\n\nHe also granted the Shire a stretch of new land: this reached from the\nancient western borders of the Shire, the White Downs, to the Tower\nHills.\n\nThe area between the downs and the hills became known as the WESTMARCH.\n\nThe eldest daughter of mayor Samwise Gamgee, Elanor the Fair, married\nFastred of Greenholm, and they moved to the Westmarch. After the passing\nof master Samwise, they and their children became known as the\n_Fairbairns of the Towers_ or _Wardens of Westmarch_, and the Red Book\nof Frodo and Bilbo Baggins passed into their keeping, becoming known as\nthe _Red Book of Westmarch_.\n\nGovernmentally, the Westmarch was a region of itself, and like Buckland\nacross the river Brandywine it was not part of any of the four Farthings\nof the Shire."

    "name": "Tharbad",
    "lotr_page_id": "566",
    "text": "THARBAD was a fortified town on the River Greyflood, in the southern\nedge of Eriador in Middle-earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nTharbad was originally the name given to a ford, high up along the once\ndensely forested banks of the Gwathló, where;\n\n_..the land was almost flat, and the waters became sluggish, tending to\nspread into fenland._ Above Tharbad the river was forked, with both\nbranches having converged from out of _a network of swamps, pools and\neyots, where the only inhabitants were hosts of swans, and many other\nwaterbirds._\n\nIn the early Second Age, this huge fenland north-east of Tharbad, which\nthe elves named 'Nîn-in-Eilph', the 'Swanfleet', entered the southern\npart of the Ñoldorin realm Eregion, and Tharbad is first mentioned in\nthe sixth century of that Age;\n\n_...no records are now left of the later voyages that Aldarion made, but\nit is known that he went much on land as well as sea, and went up the\nRiver Gwathló as far as Tharbad, and there met Galadriel._\n\nSuch early river voyages were made by “hardy explorers” of Númenor, in\n“ships of smaller draught” (UT), but such journeys up the Gwathló\nincreased rapidly after the Numenoreans constructed a small harbour at\nthe river's estuary to exploit the local timber: 'Vinyalondë', 'the New\nHaven'.\n\nBy SA 1695, the Numenoreans were devastating the forests below Tharbad,\nand had been obliged to build forts both at the Haven and along the\nriver, to protect their shipbuilding yards and “great wood-stores” (UT)\nfrom the local population, who were understandably hostile:\n\n_..the Numenoreans treated them as enemies, and became ruthless in their\nfellings, giving no thought to husbandry or replanting._\n\nDespite overrunning all of Eriador in the war which began in that year,\nSauron:\n\n“..had not enough force to spare for any assault upon the forts..”(UT),\nbut late in the war it is recorded that he\n\n_summoned more forces, which were approaching from the south-east, and\nwere indeed in Enedwaith at the Crossing of Tharbad, which was only\nlightly held._\"\n\nWhether Tharbad's defences - which presumably consisted of the most\nnortherly of the Gwathló's river forts - were overcome is uncertain, but\nTharbad did become the site of Battle of the Gwathló, where after having\nhis army caught in the rear by Ciryatur, who had hurried up river from\nLond Daer, “Sauron was routed utterly..”\n\nTharbad is not mentioned in surviving records for more than 1500 years\nafter the war: the whole region was largely ignored by the elves and the\nNúmenóreans following the destruction of Eregion and the forests “and\nthe continued hostility of the surviving natives.”(TPoMe)\n\nThe site of the ford became very important after the founding of Gondor\nand Arnor in SA 3320, however, and saw extensive development;\n\n_In the early days of the kingdoms the most expeditious route from one\nto the other (except for great armaments) was found to be by sea to the\nancient port at the head of the estuary of the Gwathlo and so to the\nriver-port of Tharbad, and thence by the road._\n\nA need had arisen “..to undertake the great works of drainage and\ndyke-building that (would make) a great port on the site where Tharbad\nstood..”\n\nThird Age\n\nTo this end, the ford was deepened to receive seagoing vessels, and the\nmassive fenlands above it were extensively drained, until a much smaller\nSwanfleet was all that remained. Tharbad's new river-port was spanned by\na bridge, the immense labour of which “was shared by the North and South\nKingdoms”, and included “a fortified town and haven about the great\nbridge over the Greyflood..”\n\nThese fortifications around the town were “raised there on great\nearthworks on both sides of the river..” (UT), and 'The Great South\nRoad', which was built at the same time to connect the two nations,\npassed across the bridge via “long causeways that carried the road to it\non either side across the fens..” (UT).\n\nSome things did not change, however: Tharbad was the only settlement of\nNúmenóreans in Enedwaith, because the area beyond the fortified town\n“was of little concern to them, except for the patrolling and upkeep of\nthe Great Royal Road” (UT). Nevertheless, “A considerable garrison of\nsoldiers, mariners and engineers  kept there until the seventeenth\ncentury of the Third Age..” (UT).\n\nFrom about TA 1150, it is incidentally recorded that a tribe of hobbits\nmigrated to the fens above Tharbad, and spread onto the land along the\nCauseway south-east of the town over several centuries, but they left\naround TA 1630;\n\n_..because the land and clime of Eriador, especially in the east,\nworsened and became unfriendly._\n\nTheir departure and the deterioration in the weather occurred around the\ntime of the Great Plague of TA 1636, which almost completely depopulated\nCardolan, one of Arnor's 'successor states' with whom Gondor would have\nshared Tharbad's maintenance. Cardolan's few surviving Dunedain -\nincluding those in Tharbad - fled west to Arthedain. Gondor too was\ndevastated, and in the years following the Plague, traffic along the\nroad through Tharbad declined considerably, as “many parts of Eriador\n(had become) desolate.” (LR): little wonder that “from then onwards, the\nregion fell quickly into decay..” (UT).\n\nSurvivors of the Plague did remain in Tharbad, however, and the road\nthrough it continued to be a significant trade route for another 350\nyears, until the fall of Arthedain in TA 1974. The town's importance\ncontinued to decline, however, and by TA 2050, the nearby native\nDunlendings, as well as the people left in Tharbad no doubt;\n\n_..ceased in fact to be subjects of Gondor; the Royal Road was unkempt\nin Enedwaith, and the Bridge of Tharbad became ruinous, and was replaced\nonly by a dangerous ford._\n\nTharbad was still inhabited for another 862 years, despite the absence\nof any sort of central government, presumably by a people akin to the\nBree-men and Dunlendings. During this period, the decrepit remains of\nthe Great South Road above Tharbad became known as 'The Greenway', even\nafter Tharbad itself was finally “ruined and deserted” (LR) in TA 2912,\nwhen great floods devastated Enedwaith following the Fell Winter.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring a century later;\n\n_When Boromir made his great journey from Gondor to Rivendell - the\ncourage and hardihood required is not fully recognized in the narrative\n- the North-South Road no longer existed except for the crumbling\nremains of the causeways, by which a hazardous approach to Tharbad might\nbe achieved, only to find ruins on dwindling mounds, and a dangerous\nford formed by the ruins of the bridge, impassable if the river had not\nthere been slow and shallow - but wide._\n\nOthers occasionally crossed the ruined bridge - at their peril -\nincluding the Ringwraiths, servants and spies of Sauron, as well as the\nRangers of the North who sought Aragorn in Rohan in TA 3019.\n\nFourth Age\n\nIn the early Fourth Age, the “ruined town” was probably rebuilt and\nresettled at last by King Elessar, and repopulated by both Rohirrim and\nMen of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTharbad was a Sindarin word that meant 'The Crossing Place'. or 'across\nway'",

    "name": "Khazad-dûm",
    "lotr_page_id": "6585",
    "text": "Khazad-dûm, also commonly known as Moria or the Dwarrowdelf, was an underground kingdom beneath the Misty Mountains. It was known\nfor being the ancient realm of the Dwarves of Durin's Folk. Khazad-dûm was\nthe greatest kingdom ever by the Dwarves and one of the greatest\nkingdoms ever established.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation\n\nMoria, or as it was known in the ancient days Khazad-dûm, was founded by\nDurin the Deathless. Durin awoke at Mount Gundabad, in the Misty\nMountains, in the period of time known as the Years of the Trees, and\ncame upon a shimmering lake beneath the mountain Celebdil with a crown\nof stars reflected in its waters. He named it Kheled-zaram as it was\nknown in Dwarvish tongue, the Mirrormere. Thereafter it remained a\nrevered place amongst the Dwarves. In the caves above the lake, Durin's\nfolk built Moria.\n\nFirst Age\n\nDurin thus became King Durin l of Khazad-dum, the first of the Seven\nFathers of the Dwarves.\n\n\n\nMany centuries later, the Dwarves continued to name their kings after\nhim, as they believed that all other rulers of Moria were\nre-incarnations of Durin who wished to live amongst his people once\nagain. Millennia passed and the caverns of Khazad-dûm became ever more\nfamous in Middle-earth and many kings were set upon the throne of Durin\nthe Deathless. The gates were kept open, as there was no shadow on the\nworld at that point, and the Dwarves were on very friendly terms with\nthe Elves.\n\nSecond Age\n\nIn SA 40 after the fall of Beleriand in the War of Wrath and the Dwarves\nof Nogrod had deserted their city, the city was enriched in numbers,\nsmithing, crafting, and masonry. These factors ever strengthened\nKhazad-dûm and brought prosperity to their city. \n\nWith the fall of Beleriand in the north, the Ñoldor looked for a new\nland to call home. They founded the land west of Moria, Eregion. A rare\nfriendship sprang up between the Elves and the Dwarves of this new land,\nand they each aided each other in constructing the magical Western-gate\nof Moria, and went so far that they even presented King Durin lll with a\nlesser Ring of Power. The bond between Khazad-dûm and Eregion suddenly\ncame to end as, in SA 1697, the Dark Lord Sauron corrupted the country\nof the elves, and despite the best efforts of the Dwarves to help them,\nhe succeeded in destroying the fair land driving away all the elves,\nthough the Elves managed to win the war against Sauron, the Dwarves were\nnot that fortunate. At this time the Doors of Durin were flung shut and\nsealed against Sauron's forces, and Khazad-dûm began a long seclusion\nfrom the outside world. It was at this time that the Orcs invaded Mount\nGundabad, taking it from the Kingdom of Durin for themselves.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nThroughout the beginning of the Third Age, the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm\nexpanded its treasure, but its numbers began to dwindle. The majority of\ntheir wealth was based on their hoards of Mithril of which they mined in\ntheir deepest tunnels, and as the centuries went by the Dwarves delved\never deeper for the precious metal. \n\nIn TA 1980, they dug too deeply and greedily for Mithril and to their\nloss they unearthed a nameless terror in the depths beneath the city.\nThis dreadful creature wrought destruction throughout the city wiping\nout most of the Dwarves and slaying King Durin VI. Thereafter the\ncreature was named Durin's Bane. After the Dwarves had left, Khazad-dûm\ngathered dust and stood dark and empty, but for the sinister creature\nthat lurked in the depths. This was when it was named Moria, the Black\nPit.\n\nThe monster, later revealed as a Balrog of Morgoth, remained alone in\nMoria for nearly five centuries until it was populated once again, but\nnot by Dwarves. The Orcs, refugees from the north, began to raid the\nabandoned city of its treasures and made a decision to occupy it. They\ncame upon the Balrog and began to worship it as their deity. Mordor\nstarted to send out troops of Orcs and Cave Trolls to populate Moria,\nmaking an evil place for them to multiply. During the Battle of\nAzanulbizar, many of these Orcs were felled in the valley beneath the\neastern gate of Moria in TA 2799, and the numbers were reduced\ndramatically. But the Balrog still remained and many Orcs and Trolls\nwith him, and so Khazad-dûm stayed evil for the time being.\n\nThe wizard Gandalf entered the city for the first time at some point\nbetween TA 2845 and TA 2850 searching for King Thrain ll, who had\nrecently disappeared on a journey to Lonely Mountain.\n\nBalin's Expedition\n\n\n\nIn TA 2989, the Longbeards, descendants of the ancient Durin Folk living\nat the Lonely Mountain, ignited an attempt to reclaim and recolonize\ntheir ancestral dwelling - Khazad-dûm. The expedition was led by Balin\nson of Fundin, one of Thorin Oakenshield's Company of Dwarves who\naccompanied Bilbo Baggins on the Quest of Erebor. He led a group of\nDwarves from Lonely Mountain to Moria, and successfully eviscerated a\nconsiderable amount of Orcs, taking many of the eastern halls and\nrecovering priceless ancestral treasures such as Durin's Axe. However,\nthe number of Orcs was too great compared to their small company and\nall, including Balin, were slain in TA 2994.\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\n\n\nWhen the Hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin; the Men Aragorn and\nBoromir; the Dwarf Gimli; the Elf Legolas; and the Wizard Gandalf set\nout from Rivendell on the Quest of the Ring, they were forced to make\ntheir way through Moria after the failed attempt of climbing\nCaradhras (Redhorn) where they were pursued by Wargs. They entered\nthrough the western-gate near a lake with dark waters from which a\ntentacular monster emerged and attempted to kill Frodo. When inside, the\nFellowship passed through many tunnels and great halls until finally\nreaching a chamber and a book, explaining the last accounts of the\nLongbeards.\n\nThey were then taken by surprise as Orcs and cave trolls pursued them\nthrough Moria to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm where the Balrog rose from the\ndepths. Gandalf bravely confronted the creature and the two briefly\ndueled on the bridge before plunging together into the abyss below. This\nsaved Gandalf's friends' lives as they carried on out of Moria into\nDimrill Dale. Gandalf and the Balrog both survived the fall; the wizard\nthen pursued the monster up the Great Stair to the peak of\nCelebdil, where a final battle took place. In the end, Gandalf defeated\nthe Balrog and cast its corpse down onto the mountain side, before\nsuccumbing to the wounds of his battle.\n\nFourth Age and beyond\n\nEventually, Moria was reclaimed by the Dwarves of Durin's Folk under\nDurin VII who became King of Durin's Folk and of Khazad-dûm and lived\nthere ever after.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Moria_ means “black chasm”' in Sindarin. KHAZAD-DÛM means “Delving of\nthe Dwarves” in Dwarvish.\n\nOther names\n\n-   DWARROWDELF\n-   HADHODROND\n-   HALLS OF DURIN\n-   MINES OF MORIA\n-   PHURUNARGIAN\n\n _The Atlas of Middle-earth,_ The Third Age, “Migrations of Hobbits”\n\n _The Atlas of Middle-earth,_ The Lord of the Rings, “Moria”\n\n _The Atlas of Middle-earth,_ The Third Age, “Migrations of Hobbits”\n\n _The Atlas of Middle-earth,_ The Lord of the Rings, “Moria”\n\n _The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring,_ Book Two,\nChapter IV: “A Journey in the Dark”\n\n _The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring,_ Book Two,\nChapter V: “The Bridge of Khazad-dûm”\n\n _The Complete Guide to Middle-earth_",

    "name": "Lindon",
    "lotr_page_id": "248",
    "text": "LINDON was a Elven Kingdom founded by Gil-galad at the beginning of the\nSecond Age. It was the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history\nof Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It was\nruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor, who,\nduring that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe realm endured through the Third Age, though diminished, and was the\nsite of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as well as the Ring-bearers,\nsailed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nLindon was located in what remained of Ossiriand; the Land of Seven\nRivers and all that was left of the peninsula of Beleriand after the War\nof Wrath. The mountains, partially sunk in the ruin of Beleriand,\nformed a portion of the realm's east border. The realm reached as far\nnorth over the mountains as the Little Lune. North of that boundary was\nwhat remained of the Dwarf kingdom of Belegost. After the ruin of\nBeleriand, Gil-Galad founded the realm of Lindon, which encompassed all\nthe land west of the Blue Mountains and east of the sea in the North of\nMiddle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke the realm of Lindon into Forlindon\nand Harlindon. The Grey Havens lay at the mouth of the river Lune.\nThrough a break in the Blue Mountains, the land of Eriador lay to the\neast, and farther southeast laid the Shire. Eastward also lay the\nKingdom of Eregion, at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which was also\nruled by Gil-Galad under the lordship of Celebrimbor. Towards the\nend of the Second Age, the realm of Arnor was established by Elendil to\nthe northeast of Lindon.\n\nThe lands of Lindon were said to be lush and green, with thick forests\nlining the foothills of the Blue Mountains. The havens of the elves were\nfound along the Gulf of Lune, where the land became rocky yet lush along\nthe coast. Tolkien stated that Lindon was Elven country “where no Man\ndwells”. It was the last realm that was fair and free. It also had a\nmildly tempered climate, with mild winters and mild summers.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Second Age\n\n_Lindon_ was another name for the Ossiriand in East Beleriand, where the\nLaiquendi dwelt.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, those Elves who had sought refuge on the coast\nof the sea at the mouths of the river Sirion removed into the land that\nwas left in the northwest of Middle-earth. They, led by Gil-Galad,\nestablished the realm of Lindon in SA 1. In the North at Forlindon\nGil-galad ruled a majority of Noldorin Elves. In southern Harlindon,\nCeleborn ruled a fiefdom of many Sindar and the remaining Green Elves of\nBeleriand under Gil-Galad. He did not rule under Gil-galad for long,\nthough, eventually removing to the shores of Lake Nenuial with his wife,\nGaladriel. At the Grey Havens Círdan was the lord of many shipbuilders\nof the Teleri who survived the ruin of the First Age. The Elves believed\nnow that the threat of Morgoth was removed, and Lindon became a fair\nkingdom. Gil-galad and the Elves of Lindon had a very strong friendship\nwith Númenor and its kings before the Darkening of Númenor.\n\nEarly in the sixth century of the Second Age, the first ships of Númenor\nreturned to Middle-earth. Vëantur, father-in-law of Tar-Meneldur, led\nthe first expedition. Later he returned with his grandson and heir to\nthe throne, Aldarion, and the Númenoreans were well liked by Gil-galad\nand his people. Tar-Aldarion continued his voyages to Lindon throughout\nhis reign as the sixth King of Númenor, and Gil-galad and Círdan taught\nmuch to the mariners of Númenor. Gil-galad befriended Aldarion and gave\nhim and his father, Tar-Meneldur, many gifts. After the reign of\nAldarion, Númenor was less active in the affairs of Lindon for many\nhundred years, though friendship remained.\n\nIn the twelfth century, Sauron attempted to infiltrate Lindon disguised\nas 'Annatar', the Lord of Gifts. His strength now on the mend after\nMorgoth's defeat, Sauron purposed to corrupt the strongest of all the\nremaining Elf-kingdoms. Gil-galad denied him, and so did Elrond, who\ndwelt then with the King in Forlindon. Though they did not know\nAnnatar's true identity at the time, the wise king of Lindon foresaw\nevil in Annatar. Sauron then turned his attention to Eregion, where he\nsucceeded in befriending the Noldorin smiths under Celebrimbor who\nworked there.\n\n\n\nAfter Sauron forged the One Ring at the beginning of the sixth century,\nhe declared war on the Elf-kingdoms to capture the Rings of Power they\nhad hidden from him. Gil-galad sent a small army led by Elrond east to\nthe aid of Eregion. There he joined with Celeborn, but Sauron's forces\ndefeated the combined force. His army ravaged Eregion and the rest of\nEriador, and came to the borders of Lindon. There, Gil-galad's forces\ndug in against the forces of Sauron, and were strengthened by a great\nfleet sent from Númenor by Tar-Minastir, the King of Númenor, under his\nson and heir Ciryatan. With the aid of the Númenoreans, participating in\ntheir first war upon Middle-Earth, Lindon was freed and Sauron's forces\noverthrown. Sauron returned to Mordor and focused his attention now on\nruining Númenor.\n\nIn the year SA 3319 of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and\nElendil and sons and his remnant of Faithful Númenoreans landed on the\ncoast of Middle-earth. Elendil established the Realms in Exile which\nwere the North-Kingdom of Arnor and the South-Kingdom of Gondor. He\nbecame close friends and ally with Gil-galad, and they pledged support\nto one another against the preparing blow of Sauron, who had risen to\npower once again after fleeing the ruin of Númenor.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434, and the Elves of Lindon\nformed a large part of the backbone of the Elven armies. Elendil's\nNúmenorean refugees, along with Dunedain who had removed to Middle-Earth\nbefore the destruction of Númenor, marched alongside the host of\nGil-galad, and eventually they laid siege to the Dark Tower. Sauron\nhimself then came to battle, and fought Gil-galad and Elendil. The two\nkings defeated him but died in the process. Then, Isildur son of Elendil\ncut the ring from Sauron's hand, and he was for a time defeated.\n\nThird Age\n\nAfter the death of Gil-galad, the lordship of Lindon passed to Círdan;\nand the line of Noldorin kings in Middle-Earth came to an end. The\npopulation of Lindon had been reduced by the long and bloody war with\nSauron. With the loss of their king, many of the Noldor and Sindar left\nfor Valinor. Following the war, many Elves began to come to the Grey\nHavens and sail to Valinor, further depleting Lindon's population.\nCírdan continued his shipbuilding, and had much work constructing the\nvessels to carry the Elves west. However, the kingdom began to dwindle\nas the ships continued to sail.\n\nThe Witch-king of Angmar attacked the Kingdom of Arnor in the thirteenth\ncentury of the Third Age. Lindon lent what aid it could to the Dunedain,\nbut after many years, the North-Kingdom was overthrown. The Dunedain\nwent into exile, and the kingdom of Lindon shrank rapidly into a safe\nhaven for the Elves of Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring,\nit was a shadow of its former glory, with only Grey Havens seeing\nregular traffic and activity. After Sauron's defeat, the last Elves\nbegan to sail for Valinor, and Círdan remained there well into the\nFourth Age, awaiting the last ship to sail west himself.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LINDON_ means “Land of the Singers”, from the Quenya term\n_lin_ or _lind_ (“to sing, make musical sound”) and _-on_, which\nis a common suffix for regions.",

    "text": "UMBAR was a Mannish realm to the far south of Gondor in\nMiddle-earth where the descendants of the King's Men lived, and in\nduring the Great Years was known for the sea-faring Corsairs who reigned\nthere in the havens that were built during the reign of the Kings of\nGondor.\n\nThe great cape and land-locked firth of Umbar south of the Bay of\nBelfalas formed a natural harbour of enclosing rock, but the “great\nfortress of Númenor” that was located within it was not built until SA\n2280. It was only by this time that Sauron had dared to threaten\nNúmenor;\n\n    _..the strength of his terror and mastery over men had grown\n    exceedingly great, he began to assail the strong places of the\n    Numenoreans upon the shores of the sea._\n    (from the “Akallabêth”, in The Silmarillion)\n\n\nHistory\n\nLike the earlier New Haven in Enedwaith, and the later Pelargir on the\nAnduin, Umbar became a base from which Númenórean influence spread over\nMiddle-earth. It was at Umbar that the last King of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn\nthe Golden, landed in SA 3261, to challenge Sauron:\n\n    _The fleet came at last to that place that was called Umbar, where\n    was a mighty haven that no hand had wrought. Empty and silent under\n    a sickle moon was the land when the King of the Sea set foot upon\n    the shore. For seven days he journeyed with banner and trumpet. Then\n    he sent forth heralds, and he commanded Sauron to come before him\n    and swear to him fealty._\n    ('Akallabêth' from “The Silmarillion”)\n\nAfter the Downfall of Númenor 58 years later, Umbar remained in the\nhands of the Numenoreans, in essence a Realm in Exile alongside Arnor\nand Gondor. But unlike these others, Umbar had been used by the 'King's\nMen', who had turned to the worship of Melkor in the last days of\nNúmenor. These 'King's Men' were not friendly to the Elves or to their\nfellow Númenórean survivors who were allied to the elves, and became\nknown as Black Numenoreans.\n\nTwo Black Númenórean lords known as Herumor and Fuinur, probably from\nUmbar rose to power at the end of Second Age they became very powerful\namongst the Haradrim, a neighbouring people of whom they were allied.\nTheir fate is unknown, but they likely shared Sauron's defeat at the\nhands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\n\n\n\nThe rulers of Umbar retained much influence over the Haradwaith well\ninto the Third Age. When not part of Gondor, its system of government\nwas no doubt tyrannical, but it may also have been a duumvirate: Black\nNúmenórean and Corsair Lords are paired when mentioned; Herumor/Fuinur\nfor example, and later Angamaitë/Sangahyando.\n\nGondor's power, however, eclipsed that of Umbar as the Third Age\nprogressed, and in TA 933 Gondor's King Eärnil I captured Umbar in a\nsurprise attack, although this was “at great cost.”\n\nFor the following 500 years, Umbar was an important city of Gondor: not\nonly a major seaport, but as the site of the submission of Sauron to\nAr-Pharazôn, and so served as a proud reminder of the might of the\nDúnedain of old:\n\n    _on the highest hill of the headland above the Haven they (…) set a\n    great white pillar as a monument. It was crowned with a globe of\n    crystal that took the rays of the Sun and of the Moon and shone like\n    a bright star that could be seen in clear weather even on the coasts\n    of Gondor or far out upon the western sea._\n    ('The Heirs of Elendil' from “The Peoples of Middle-earth”)\n\nUmbar's Golden Age\n\nUmbar's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-Kings”:\n\nThe Heirs of Castamir\n\n-   Castamir the Usurper the first Ship-king of Umbar- TA 1975 - TA 2106\n\n&nbsp;\n-   CASTAHER- TA 2106- TA 2177\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Angamaitë- TA 2177- TA 2247\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Sangahyando- TA 2247 - TA 2319\n\n    Many Black Numenoreans had fled Umbar from the assault of TA 933, to\n    their subjects in Near Harad, but 82 years later, in a vain attempt\n    to recapture it,\n    _the Men of the Harad, led by the lords that had been driven from\n    Umbar, came up with great power against that stronghold.._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nThis 'great power' availed the Men of Harad little, however, for despite\ninvesting and besieging the fortress of Umbar for 35 years, they failed\nto take it, as its supply was easily maintained, “because of the\nsea-power of Gondor”. In TA 1050, the late King Earnil's son Ciryandil,\n\n    _came down from the north by sea and by land, and crossing the river\n    Harnen his armies utterly defeated the Men of the Harad.._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nGondor's possession of Umbar came to an abrupt end In TA 1448, but not\nat the hands of an external foe. Following the disastrous Kin-strife,\nthe sons of Castamir the Usurper arrived there with many men and most of\nthe fleet of Gondor.\n\n    _There they made a refuge for all the enemies of the king, and a\n    lordship independent of his crown. Umbar remained at war with Gondor\n    for many lives of men.._\n    ('Appendix A' ~ “The Lord of the Rings”)\n\nThese men became known as the “Corsairs of Umbar”, and within two\ncenturies became a major threat to Gondor. In TA 1634 Castamir's\ngreat-grandsons Angamaitë and Sangahyando raided Pelargir, from Umbar,\nkilling King Minardil, but Gondor could not retaliate as it was ravaged\nby the Great Plague. Vengeance, if not swift, was certainly devastating:\n78 years after Minardil's death, his great-grand nephew succeeded in\nbriefly recapturing Umbar, and even renamed himself Umbardacil. However,\n\n    _..in the new evils that soon befell Gondor Umbar was again lost,\n    and fell into the hands of the Men of Harad._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nThroughout the rest of the Third Age, Umbar was home a new generation of\n'Corsairs of Umbar', who must have been closely related to the Haradrim,\nif not even merely Haradrim themselves. These new Corsairs were cruel\nslavers who often raided the coasts of Belfalas and Anfalas in Gondor:\nin TA 2746 for example, Amrothos, the 15th Prince of Dol Amroth fell\ndefending Dol-en-Ernil against them.\n\nIn TA 2758 Umbar joined a massive coordinated attack with Men of the\nHarad and even of Dunland, against Gondor and the new realm of Rohan:\n\n    _Three great fleets, long prepared, came up from Umbar and the\n    Harad, and assailed the coasts of Gondor in great force; and the\n    enemy made many landings, even as far north as the mouth of the\n    Isen._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nIn TA 2885 Umbar supported the Haradrim who claimed Harondor, although\nthis had long “been a debatable land between the Corsairs and the\nKings”, and when Sauron declared himself openly in TA 2951, Umbar\ndeclared its allegiance to him, and the great monument commemorating\nAr-Pharazôn's triumph at Umbar was thrown down.\n\nUmbar's fleet was largely destroyed 29 years later, when Thorongil\n(Aragorn, as it later turned out) in the service of the Steward of\nGondor Ecthelion II led a taskforce south and burned them, killing the\nCaptain of the Haven in the process.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Umbar had not fully recovered from this, but\ncould still send 50 'great ships' and smaller vessels “beyond count”, to\nraid the coastlands of Gondor and draw off major forces from the defence\nof Minas Tirith. They were once again defeated by Aragorn, and the Army\nof the Dead. With the Fall of Barad-dûr, Umbar, weakened and defeated,\nfinally lost its sovereignty and submitted to the crown of King Elessar.\n\nUmbar appeared on the bottom edge of the maps found in earlier editions\nof _The Lord of the Rings_, but it is absent from modern editions, which\nregrettably map a slightly smaller area of Middle-earth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_UMBAR_ was a Quenyan word that meant 'fate-'.",

    "text": "The WOODLAND REALM, later known as MIRKWOOD, was a kingdom of Silvan\nElves located deep in the Forest of the Wilderland beginning in the\nSecond Age. King Thranduil of the Sindar rules over the Silvan Elves.\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm, unlike many Elves, were known to be\nless wise and more dangerous, but were nevertheless one of the most\npowerful and legendary of the Elves of Middle-earth.\n\nLegolas, a key member of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age,\nhailed from here.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly\n\nDuring the latter half of the Years of the Trees and the First Age, the\nNandorin and Avarin Elves populated the forest between the Misty\nMountains and the Far East lands, mixing themselves together becoming\nSilvan Elves or Wood-elves. It is not known how they lived but it is\npossible they lived in small tribal groups wandering the forest.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath and the destruction of the Beleriand, Oropher, a\nSindarin prince formerly of Doriath who chose to stay in Middle-earth,\ncame to the forest known as Greenwood the Great. He and his company were\nwell received and well accepted as they had once lived with King\nThingol, whom they regarded as distant kin. The Sindarin company\nintended to live like the Wood-elves: natural and undisturbed. This\nnotion was appealing to the Wood-elves and Oropher was soon named their\nking, adopting their language and way of life.\n\nAfter being named King of the Woodland Realm, Oropher established his\ncapital on Amon Lanc in the southern part of the forest. The Woodland\nrealm flourished in peace with its boundaries unchanged and way of life\nundisturbed for over a millennium. Sometime after SA 1000, Oropher had\nhis capital moved further north in around the Mountains of Mirkwood. The\nmain reason for this was the growing threat of Sauron in the East.\nOropher and his people also felt threatened by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm\nand by the presence of Celeborn and Galadriel in the forest. Despite\nthese problems, the Elves of the Woodland Realm still continued to roam\nthe south of the forest westward down the Anduin.\n\nOver one hundred years after the Downfall of Númenor, the threat of\nSauron once again grew into a very real threat to Middle-earth. Oropher\nand the Elves of Lórien under Amdír both agreed that peace could not be\nresorted until Sauron was completely defeated. A large army was created\nand a combined force of Wood-elves and Galadhrim marched to support the\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men. Though they were as determined to defeat\nSauron as the others, Oropher and Amdír's army was lightly armed and\nless experienced in major warfare. They also refused to submit to the\nsupreme authority of Gil-galad due to past disputes with Ñoldor, and so\nfought independently. They suffered heavy losses and Oropher and Amdír\nwere both killed. Oropher's son survived the war and took his father's\nplace as King of the Woodland Realm.\n\nThird Age\n\nDespite the heavy losses their people had suffered during the War of the\nLast Alliance, the Elves of the Woodland Realm survived and continued\nliving peacefully in the forest for the next millennium. The peace was\nbroken in TA 1050 when a mysterious being known as the Necromancer began\nliving in the abandoned halls of Amon Lanc. Afterwards, the forest\nbecame dark and tainted, infested with Orcs, Great Spiders, and other\nmysterious and savage beings. The elves were then forced to remove\nthemselves to the northernmost part of the forest. All settlements in\nthe Mountains of Mirkwood were withdrawn and the capital and realm's\npeople relocated to a cave settlement under a wooded hill, in the\nnortheastern border of the forest. From then on, the Woodland Realm\nremained confined to the north. It was at this time that the Elves\nrenamed the forest to Mirkwood along other with other places they\nformerly occupied.\n\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm survived but lived more cautiously\nconsidering the increased danger. They traded with the neighboring\nrealms of the Lonely Mountain and Dale. This however was not to last as\nthe Elves, Rhovanion and much of Middle-earth was affected by bad\nweather culminating in the Long Winter of TA 2758 and TA 2759 and the\nFell Winter of TA 2911 - TA 2912, during which extreme cold and large\nblankets of snow plagued the lands. However, the most devastating blow\nto the Woodland Realm until the War of the Ring came in TA 2770 when the\ndragon Smaug came down from the North and destroyed both the Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain and the Mannish town of Dale. Afterwards, the elves\nmoved about the forest in secret and were very distrustful of any\nstrangers and their only contact with the outside world was trade and\noccasional visitation with the refugees of Dale living in Laketown on\nthe Long Lake. It was probably during this time that the Elves made the\nForest Path which ran across the northern forest as the only safe\npassage, as the main road that ran through was no longer safe.\n\nIn TA 2941, Thorin and Company came through the Woodland Realm on their\nway to the Lonely Mountain on The Quest of Erebor. Thranduil considered\nthem trespassers and had them imprisoned save for Bilbo, who remained\ninvisible with the use of his Magic Ring, who later released them.\nAfter the death of Smaug, Thranduil offered relief to the Men of\nLaketown for Bard’s valiant slaying of the dragon and assembled an army\nto claim part of the treasure, but Thorin refused to share it and so\nboth parties prepared for war. Bilbo tried to help the situation by\ndelivering the ancient artifact known as the Arkenstone to the Elves and\nMen.\n\nThe situation did not improve and with arrival of a Dwarven army of\nfive-hundred under Dáin II Ironfoot, and it seemed as if the Elves and\nMen would fight the Dwarves, but the timely arrival of Gandalf with a\nwarning of an army of Goblins and Wargs coming to do battle for the\ntreasure changed everything. The Elves, Men, and Dwarves were forced to\njoin forces and fight a common enemy. The Wood-elves and their allies,\nincluding the late-arriving Eagles, defeated the orcs and many lay dead,\nbut peace finally returned to the region with the Orcs defeated and news\nof the White Council having driven the Necromancer out of Dol Guldur.\n\nPeace for the Elves of the Woodland Realm reigned for decades until Dol\nGuldur once again was inhabited by evil creatures and Mordor grew in\npower and influence. The Woodland Realm became involved directly in the\nWar of the Ring when the creature Gollum was captured by Aragorn and\nimprisoned there, but an orc raid allowed him to escape. Afterwards,\nThranduil sent his son Legolas to Rivendell as a representative of the\nWoodland Realm and to inform the Council of Gollum’s escape.\n\nThe Woodland Realm was attacked on March 15, 3019 by forces from Dol\nGuldur, becoming part of the Battles of the North. Thranduil and the\nWood-elves were victorious and the forest was eventually cleansed of all\nits enemies and as Galadriel had thrown down the walls Dol Guldur, there\nwas no longer any threat from there and the shadow was permanently\nremoved from the forest. On April 6, 3019, Thranduil met with Celeborn\nand both agreed to rename the forest Eryn Lasgalen (Wood of\nGreenleaves). Soon after the war, the forest was divided with Thranduil\nleft to rule most of the northern part.\n\nFourth Age\n\nThe Woodland Realm people played an important role during the early\nyears when a group of Elves from the Woodland Realm led by Legolas\ntraveled to Gondor and helped rebuild the city of Minas Tirith and\nreplenished and beautified the war-ravaged lands of Ithilien. It is\npresumed that the realm prospered but like the other non-mannish realms\nit most likely became isolated and unto itself. Its fate is unknown but\nas some Elves left Middle-earth during the Fourth Age and the dominion\nof Man was at hand, the Wood-elves of the Woodland Realm may have\neventually become hidden and ultimately invisible to the eyes of Men.",

    "text": "'''Orthanc '''was the black, impenetrable tower of Isengard built by the\nDúnedain. By the Great Years and the War of the Ring it was possessed by\nthe wizard Saruman the White. It stood in the centre of the Ring of\nIsengard, surrounded by great defensive walls fortified by the early Men\nof Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n''“A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the\nshelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned\nagain... one who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel,\nbeheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow\nbowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and\nfilled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams\nthat flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there\nin the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags\ndark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched\nlong lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron,\njoined by heavy chains, to the centre all the roads ran between their\nchains. There stood a tower of marvelous shape. It was fashioned by the\nbuilders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a\nthing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the\nearth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it\nwas, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were\nwelded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns,\ntheir pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives.\nBetween them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished\nstone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred feet\nabove the plain.” ''\n\n- Orthanc as depicted by J.R.R Tolkien\n\nThe tower was constructed out of four piers of stone and then hardened\nby an unknown process. No weaponry or magic that existed on Arda was\nknown to be able to harm it. Until the Ents that besieged Isengard\nduring the War of the Ring managed to inflict slight damage on the\ntower, but their efforts ultimately proved to be futile. When Grima\nthrew the Orthanc stone it fell on the stairs; the rail snapped and part\nof the staircase broke.\n\nThe only entrance to the tower was reached by a stair of twenty-seven\nsteps, the door could only be opened with the Keys of Orthanc. Above the\ndoor there was a balcony, and many tall windows higher up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nThe exact date of construction of Orthanc and establishment of Isengard\nis unknown; however it must have been built between SA 3320, the time of\nthe establishment of Arnor and Gondor, and SA 3430, when the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men was formed. Within the fortified walls of the\ntower was placed one of the Palantíri, the Stone of Orthanc. Thus,\nOrthanc was now known as one of the seven towers of the Dunedain,\nhousing the seventh seeing stone brought back from Númenor by Elendil.\n\nThird Age\n\nOrthanc suffered greatly during the Great Plague of TA 1636, and many of\nthe Numenoreans that inhabited it gradually migrated eastward.\nEventually the tower itself became deserted and its keys being moved to\nMinas Tirith to be kept by the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant in TA 2510, a small group of\nMen of Gondor travelled to Isengard and maintained the fortress on their\nown. However, the Keys of Orthanc still officially belonged to the\nStewards of Gondor.\n\nOver time, Orthanc lost its connections with Minas Tirith and the Men of\nGondor failed to maintain the tower successfully. The Dunlendings then\ntook over the fortress and launched many attacks on the Westfold. In the\nLong Winter of TA 2754, the Dunlendings were eventually starved out due\nto the famine caused by the lack of communication to all food suppliers.\nThen Saruman put in an offer for the control of Isengard and both King\nFréaláf and Steward Beren embraced the proposition with open arms. Thus,\nthe wizard was handed the keys to Orthanc.\n\n\n\nAfter gaining the control of Isengard, Saruman became greatly interested\nin the Rings of Power and began to especially desire the One. He thought\nthat if he gave time for Sauron to regain some strength, the ring would\nreveal itself to him. Therefore, as head of the White Council, Saruman\noverruled Gandalf's call for an attack on Dol Guldur, the Dark Lord's\nthen current fortress. However in TA 2941, he did agree on the attack\nwhen he found out that the servants of Sauron were searching for the\nring near the Gladden Fields.\n\n\n\nLater, Saruman's mind was corrupted and fell under the control of Sauron\nwhen he used the Stone of Orthanc—the seventh Palantiri—for the first\ntime.\n\nIn TA 3018, Gandalf rode to Isengard to meet with Saruman. It was then\nthat the wizard declared his true thoughts regarding his desire to be\nruler of Men, to possess the Ring, and to join Sauron in his evil deeds.\nGandalf refused Saruman's offer to join him and Sauron. Subsequently,\nthe wizard held Gandalf captive on Orthanc's pinnacle until he submitted\nin telling the location of the One Ring. After many weeks of\nimprisonment, Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, came unlooked for and\nbore him away.\n\nOnly months later, the Ents of Fangorn Forest launched their attack on\nIsengard. By the next day, only the tower of Orthanc remained, as it was\nhewn of one piece of impenetrable rock, and the plains below had been\ncompletely destroyed, leaving a desolate land of water and mud. Three\ndays after the battle, Theoden, Éomer, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and\nGimli approached Orthanc past a desolation of wreckage caused by the\nEnts including a huge blood-ridden white hand, and climbed its stair.\nThey parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside the tower and spoke to\nthem from a balcony above the door. After Saruman refused to cooperate\nand attempted to control the Rohirrim riding with them, Gandalf cast him\nfrom the Order of Wizards and the White Council, breaking Saruman's\nStaff. After the confrontation, Grima Wormtongue—who was inside the\ntower at the time—threw the Stone of Orthanc at the party outside as a\nparting shot.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nOne of King Elessar's first tasks he had set was the restoration of\nOrthanc. He ordered that the Palantir should be recovered and returned\nto the tower. Then Orthanc was searched and many secrets were revealed.\nIt was clear that Saruman had been hoarding many ancient treasures and\nheirlooms during his time there. With the aid of Wormtongue, Saruman had\nacquired many jewels and heirlooms belonging to Eorl. Soon a hidden door\nwas found and inside a casket they found two precious objects: one of\nwhich was a small gold case attached to a chain - this was used by\nIsildur to bear the One Ring; and second of which was the Elendilmir -\nthe 'white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of mithril' that had\nbeen lost since Isildur's demise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with\nreverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of\nArnor. It was revealed that Saruman had found the remains of Isildur and\nhad burned them.\n\nOrthanc and the plains of Isengard around it remained part of the\nReunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. However, King Elessar granted the\nEnts complete self-governance of the area surrounding the tower. This\nnew forest became known as the Treegarth of Orthanc.\n\n\nPinnacle of Orthanc\n\n\n\nThe Pinnacle of Orthanc was the summit of Saruman's tower. Its corners\nwere razor-edged points with room for at least two men to stand. It was\naccessed by a flight of thousands of stairs, which Saruman would use to\nreach the top and observe the stars.\n\nIt was here where Saruman imprisoned Gandalf at the start of the War of\nthe Ring, which caused him to be delayed in meeting with Frodo. He was\nrescued by the Great Eagle Gwaihir, sent by Radagast the Brown.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAccording to Tolkien, its name is both Sindarin for “Mount Fang”, and\nRohirric for “Cunning Mind”. The latter is more likely to be its real\nmeaning, as the word _Orthanc_ is a real Old English word (Old English\nbeing the linguistic basis for Rohirric); the Sindarin name being no\nmore than a poetic coincidence. In Old English, Orþanc means “cunning\ndevice”, but Tolkien has said this is merely a coincidence.",

    "name": "Arda",
    "lotr_page_id": "238",
    "text": "ARDA (Quenya; IPA: ), also known as EARTH, was the world in which all\npeoples of Middle-earth lived.\n\n\nHistory\n\nArda consisted of land masses, chiefly the continents of Middle-earth\nand Aman, oceans and seas, and an atmosphere. It was a part of Eä, the\ncreated World (i.e., of the whole Tolkienian star system). Arda was\ncreated, together with the rest of Eä, through the Music of the Ainur,\nand was set apart as a dwelling place for the Children of Ilúvatar (that\nis, Elves and Men). When Eä was created, many of the Ainur chose to\ndwell within it as long as it should last, and they built Arda and chose\nto reside there. The most powerful of these Ainur were called the Valar,\nthe Powers of the World.\n\nOriginally, Arda was flat, rather than spherical (though it still had\nmountains and valleys), and the Valar built it to a symmetric plan. They\nlit up Arda with great lamps, and the explosion of biological life that\nensued became known as the First Spring. This period ended when Melkor\nlaunched a surprise attack, destroying not only the lamps but the layout\nof the world.\n\nAfter this time, Arda was surrounded by a mighty , Ekkaia or the\nEncircling Sea, and the continents were separated from each other by\nBelegaer, called the Great Sea. During the Years of the Trees, Valinor,\nthe realm of the Valar occupying most of the continent of Aman, was lit\nup by the Two Trees. Middle-earth was dark. At first it was largely\ncontrolled by Melkor and his servants, but when the Elves awoke the\nValar went to war against Melkor, defeating him and imprisoning him in\nthe Halls of Mandos for “three ages”. During this war, many of the\nwesternmost areas of Middle-earth were drowned beneath the waves.\n\nDuring the captivity of Melkor, the Valar invited the Elves to dwell\nwith them in Aman. Many Elves accepted this invitation, and set out for\nthe West; these became known as the Eldar. Along the way, some groups of\nEldar, notably the Nandor and the Sindar, chose to remain in\nMiddle-earth. The Sindar settled in the region of Beleriand, a\nnorth-western coastal area of Middle-earth.\n\nWhen the Years of the Sun began, Arda experienced the so-called Second\nSpring, a new period of growth and vitality as a result of the light of\nthe sun in Middle-earth. At that time, Men also awoke in the east of\nMiddle-earth.\n\nAt the end of the First Age, Beleriand was destroyed during the War of\nWrath, and much of it sank beneath Belegaer; only a few high points,\nsuch as Himring (later Himling) and parts of Dorthonion (later Tol\nFuin), remained above sea level as islands.\n\nIn the Second Age, Númenor was raised in the Great Sea for the Edain.\nThis island existed through most of the Second Age, but was destroyed as\na result of the pride of the Númenórean people in defying the Ban of the\nValar and sailing to Aman in the west.\n\nDuring the downfall of Númenor, Arda was made round. The Undying Lands\n(Aman and Tol Eressëa) were taken out of the world, and could only be\nreached by the Elves, following the _straight road_ that was granted to\nthem. As Aman was taken away from Arda, new lands and continents were\ncreated.\n\nSouth of Middle-earth was the Dark Land and east of it was the Land of\nthe Sun.\n\nTolkien stated many times that Arda was our world in a fictional time,\nso we can interpret the known regions of Middle-earth as Europe. Tolkien\nstated that The Shire was situated at roughly the same latitude as the\nMidlands of England, while Minas Tirith in Gondor was at the same\nlatitude of , putting Mount Doom and Mordor in the general region of .\nHowever, the entire continent of Middle-earth extends beyond the regions\nknown to Gondor, far into the uncharted East and South, and Middle-earth\nprobably encompassed all of what later became . Information regarding\nboth was very vague. To the south were the Hither Lands including Harad,\nthough “Harad” means “South” and while properly used for the region\nimmediately south of Gondor. Near Harad and Far Harad probably\ncorresponded to North Africa and sub-Saharan , respectively. There were\nmany stretches of sun-scorched desert in Near Harad, but like Africa\nthere was supposedly a jungle beyond it which few had ever ventured to,\nfrom which the great Oliphaunts were found. Tolkien also said that the\nHaradrim loosely corresponded to the (though “Haradrim” refers to a\ngroup of many races, not just the one). Men of Far Harad are also\ndescribed as being black skinned. The vast eastern lands were\ncollectively referred to as Rhûn, and like Harad they are uncharted. The\nEasterlings, like the Haradrim, were a diverse collection of many races,\nranging from nomadic steppe horsemen akin to Turkish and Mongol tribes,\nto civilized and rich kingdoms stretching across the vast Eastlands.\nRhûn supposedly stopped at another ocean at its eastern end. In ancient\ntimes the great chain of the Red Mountains, the eastern counterpart of\nthe Blue Mountains of the west, ran north to south near here (all of the\nworld was once symmetrical at the dawn of time). The Elves first awoke\nin the east, though their original home of Cuiviénen doubtless no longer\nexisted by the Third Age. It is not known if the Red Mountains\nthemselves survived into the Third Age, either intact or in some reduced\nform (like the Blue Mountains). The lands of the east probably\ncollectively corresponded to the Asian continent, if Harad was taken as\nAfrica. It is said that the Blue Wizards went far into the east of Rhûn\nand beyond to stir up rebellions against Sauron in the lands he held\nsway over, though the tales of these struggles never reached the west in\ndetail. It is also said that the Blue Wizards somehow failed in their\nmission; this is interpreted several ways, either that like Saruman they\nset themselves up as lords of men, or that like Radagast they started to\ncare more for the local people they were charged with protecting than\nMiddle-earth as a whole and then refused to return. Tolkien did state\nthat many of the “magic cults” and orders that exist in Asian countries\ntoday can trace their origins back to the Blue Wizards teaching local\npeoples of the east the magical arts.\n\nThere was also a separate continent south and east of Middle-earth\ncalled the Dark Land, which could correspond to . Another separate\ncontinent to the east of Middle-earth was the Land of the Sun, so called\nbecause when the world was flat the Gates of the Sun were near there,\nand it would be scorched. After the Fall of Númenor, Arda is made round\nand new lands are created east of Middle-earth (and west too, now that\nthe world is round and can be circumnavigated), out of these Sun Lands\nthat are apparently meant to be North and South , though none of\nTolkien's mythology deals with what happens there. The Sun Lands were\nknown to contain a north to south running mountain range which could\ncorrespond to the Rockies and Andes mountain ranges.\n\n\nArda Unmarred\n\nThe original world as built by the Valar was referred to as ARDA\nUNMARRED. This world was effectively destroyed by the wars of the Valar\nand Melkor, and only Valinor still resembled it in part. Arda Unmarred\nwas a symmetrical world with everlasting light.\n\n\nArda Marred\n\nARDA MARRED was the name given to the world as it is: the world after\nthe wars of the Valar and Melkor, and the dispersing of Melkor's Fëa and\nhröa throughout the world. It is this world from which are formed the\nFëa and hröa of the Children of Ilúvatar, and therefore it is at times a\ncruel and evil world with plagues, extreme colds, heat, and other\nconcepts which do not exist in Arda Unmarred.\n\nArda Marred also broke the design of Elvish immortality: in Arda Marred\nElves slowly fade, until at last they are little more than wraiths. Only\nin Valinor was this fading delayed, which is one reason all Elves have\nno choice but to sail to Valinor in the end. One of the special\nabilities of the Rings of Power was that they could delay the effects of\ntime, and as such were used by Elrond and Galadriel to preserve their\nrealms. After the destruction of the One Ring in the Fourth Age, the\nElvish rings' power over time was also lost, so the last of the Eldar\nhad no choice but to leave Middle Earth and sail west for Valinor.\n\n\nArda Healed\n\nARDA HEALED is the prophecy that Arda Marred will be restored: it will\nbe like Arda Unmarred but better, since it will also incorporate all the\ngood things of Arda Marred. Arda Healed will be created after the Dagor\nDagorath, when Morgoth will finally be destroyed, and the world broken.\nAfterwards, a new world will be created and will be known as Arda\nHealed.\n\nGaladriel's words while parting with Treebeard at Isengard in The Return\nof the King are “Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under\nthe wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we\nmay meet in the spring. Farewell!”. This might imply that Beleriand will\nbe recovered after the Dagor Dagorath. It is however unknown, since Arda\nHealed will contain all the good things of Arda Marred, whether Númenor\nwill also be recovered or not.",

    "text": "DOL AMROTH was a feudal principality which formed part of the Kingdom of\nGondor in the southern reaches of that realm. It was ruled by the Prince\nof Dol Amroth; the banner of the Silver Swan of Dol Amroth flew\nalongside that of the White Tree throughout the Third Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\n[An artist's rendition of the fortified city DOL AMROTH.]\n\nElven refugees from Beleriand settled the area and established an Elven\nsettlement about 50 miles north of the promontory, at Edhellond.\n\nDol Amroth dated back to the late Second Age, when “the Faithful” began\nsettling there. The first Lord of Dol Amroth was Galador, son of Imrazôr\nof the Númenóreans. Imrazôr was the son of Adrahil I, who was already\nknown as the Prince of Belfalas. At some point, Imrazôr moved to the\narea where once was the elven haven of Edhellond. According to\ntradition, there he married Mithrellas, a Silvan Elf of Lórien who had\naccompanied Nimrodel, the beloved of Lórien's king Amroth, on her\njourney towards Edhellond, but had become lost along with her mistress.\nTherefore Galador and his descendants had claim to Elven blood.\n\nAfter Imrazôr's death (Mithrellas' fate is nowhere described, only that\nshe eventually left Imrazôr and Galador), Galador went on to found the\ncity and later the Principality of Dol Amroth. He is counted as its\nfirst Lord. The specific date of its foundation is nowhere recounted.\n\n\n\nThe city of Dol Amroth was built south of Edhellond at the inlet of\nCobas Haven in the Bay of Belfalas. The standard of the city was a\nsilver swan, as seen in the banners carried by the knights from there at\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nThe lands of Dol Amroth were also known as _DOR-EN-ERNIL_, or 'Lands of\nthe Prince': initially this name was applied to the area of Belfalas\nwhere Adrahil I and Imrazôr lived, but after Galador it was also applied\nto the area of Dol Amroth itself.\n\nImrahil was one of the commanders of the army of Gondor during the War\nof the Ring, and for a while commanded the city of Minas Tirith. After\nthe War he went back to Dol Amroth, remaining a counselor to King\nElessar. He was succeeded by his son Elphir. Imrahil's sister Finduilas\nmarried Denethor II, Steward of Gondor and was the mother of Boromir and\nFaramir. Lothíriel, daughter of Imrahil, married Éomer, the King of\nRohan.\n\n\nPopulation\n\nThe first settlers of the area were Sindar from Beleriand until The\nFaithful from Númenor came to the premonitory. The last Elves left in TA\n1981.\n\nThe people of Dol Amroth were tall, grey-eyed, and dark-haired. They\nwere famous as the most skillful harp players in all of Gondor, and\nplayed at the coronation of Aragorn II. The inhabitants of Dol Amroth\nand in the lands nearby were some of the few people of Gondor who\nspoke Sindarin on a daily basis.\n\nThe southern Dúnedain that settled in Dol Amroth never intermarried with\nso-called “Middle Men” so that as a result, the entire population of Dol\nAmroth consisted of people with pure Dúnedain and Elvish ancestry. The\nprinces of Dol Amroth (House of Dol Amroth) were of high Númenórean and\nElvish descent due to the union of Mithrellas and Imrazôr. Inhabitants\nof Dol Amroth were generally long-lived due to this noble ancestry.\n\n\nPrinces of Dol Amroth\n\n\n\nHere follows a list of the line of Princes. Adrahil and Imrazor were\ngiven the titles of Prince of Belfalas but their descendants after them\nwere known as the Princes of Dol Amroth.

At the end of the War of the Ring, Saruman's\ntreachery destroyed much of the Shire, and Hobbiton suffered greatly.\nThe Old Mill had been replaced with a noxious factory-like structure,\nand many trees had been cut down.\n\nAfter the servants of Saruman had been expelled from the Shire, Sam\nGamgee used magic soil from the garden of the Elf-queen Galadriel to\nheal the Shire in general, but with particular attention to Hobbiton.",

    "text": "The SHIRE was the homeland of the majority of the Hobbits in\nMiddle-earth. It was located in the northwestern portion of\nMiddle-earth, in the northern region of Eriador, within the remains of\nthe Kingdom of Arnor.\n\nBy the Third Age it was one of the few heavily-populated areas left in\nEriador. Its name in Westron was SÛZA, “Shire,” or SÛZAT, “The Shire.”\nContrary to popular misconception, The Shire was not the birthplace of\nFrodo Baggins, as he was born in Buckland, which at the time was not\npart of the Shire, even though it was colonized by Shire Hobbits.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, Saruman (known then as _Sharkey_) tried to\ntake control of it for a very short period, but was killed in the Battle\nof Bywater, which ended the War of the Ring.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSettlement\n\nThe Shire was settled by Hobbits in the year TA 1601 (Year 1 in Shire\nReckoning). The Hobbits (who originally lived in the vale of Anduin) had\nmigrated west over the Misty Mountains in the decades before, and lived\nin Dunland and parts of the depopulated Arnor splinter-realms Cardolan\nand Rhudaur before coming to the Shire. It has been speculated that the\nHobbits had originally moved west to escape the evils of Mirkwood, and\nthe trouble caused by the Easterlings.\n\nThe Shire was a part of Arthedain and as such a part of Arnor. The\nHobbits were granted official permission from King Argeleb II at Norbury\nto settle in the Shire, which was not populated at the time, and was\nseen as the King's hunting grounds. The Hobbits considered themselves to\nbe subjects of the King, and sent some support troops to the great\nbattles Arnor fought against The Witch-king of Angmar. For reasons\nunknown, Angmar did not attack The Shire after it conquered Arthedain.\nTales claim that some Hobbit bowmen were involved at the Battle of\nFornost, although no tales of it exist in Men records. After the fall of\nArnor, the Shire remained a small but self-governing province of the\nKingdom of Gondor, the Thain's office representing the Crown.\n\nThird Age and beyond\n\nThis peaceful situation changed after Bilbo Baggins' acquisition of the\nOne Ring in the year SR 1343 of the Shire Reckoning. Shortly after the\nfirst events that led to the War of the Ring (autumn of the year 1419 in\nShire Reckoning), the Shire was first visited by the Nine Ringwraiths\nwho went as far as Hobbiton, and then it was captured by Saruman. It was\nliberated with the help of Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin after the end of\nthe Quest of the Ring. After Aragorn's return as the King of Arnor and\nGondor, the Shire became a protected enclave inside the Reunited\nKingdom. Aragorn is known to have issued an edict that forbade the\nentrance of full-sized Men into the Shire.\n\n\nGeography\n\n[The fields of the Shire] The Brandywine River bound the Shire from the\neast (Shire Hobbits also lived in Buckland, which lay east of the river\nand west of the Hedge protecting the Shire from an invasion from the Old\nForest; however, Buckland was not formally recognized as part of The\nShire until after the War of the Ring, when it was giving officially to\nThe Shire by Aragorn II Elessar). From the north and the west, the Shire\nhad no topographical borders, rather it was bounded by the ancient south\nand east roads, and by vague geographical features such as the Tower\nHills.\n\nThe Shire was quite densely populated in certain areas, with many\nvillages and a few towns, but it still was open enough to allow for wide\nforested areas and marshes. The total amount of land calculated in\nsquare miles was 21,400, probably not including the Westmarch.\n\nClimate\n\nAs stated by J. R. R. Tolkien, the climate of the Shire was very similar\nto that of England; cool, but with not overly cold winters, and with\nfairly warm summers. Rainfall was fairly frequent, with snow being much\nmore rare. Usually, the Shire was warm enough that the rivers did not\nfreeze over, except during the Fell Winter.\n\nAccording to computer models by the university of Bristol, the average\ntemperature of Hobbitton was about 7.0 degrees Celsius, which confirms\nTolkien's writings of the Shire having a climate rather like England.\n\n\n\nGovernment and Defense\n\nThe Shire was originally divided in four Farthings (Northfarthing,\nSouthfarthing, Eastfarthing, and Westfarthing), but Buckland and later\nthe Westmarch were added to it in The Fourth Age. Within the Farthings\nthere were some smaller, unofficial divisions such as family lands;\nnearly all the Tooks lived in or near Tuckborough, for instance. In many\ncases a Hobbit's last name indicates where their family came from:\nSamwise Gamgee's last name derived from _Gamwich_, where the family\noriginated. Outside the Farthings, Buckland itself was named for the\nOldbucks (later Brandybucks). See further _Regions of the Shire_.\n\nThe Shire's small size, relative lack of importance in terms of\ngeographical position, natural resources, or even concerning hobbits\nthemselves made it too modest an objective for conquest from the more\ndominant races of the East and South. More importantly, the Shire was\nguarded and protected by the Dunedain Rangers, who patrolled the borders\nand kept out intruders, though Tolkien notes that many of the current\nhobbits of the Shire have grown so accustomed to this that they have\nforgotten their protectors altogether.\n\nHowever the limited government of the Shire did hold its own voluntary\npolice force known as Shirriffs that helped to keep the Shire safe,\nusually from trespassing beasts and collecting lost farm animals, rather\nthan from enemy forces. The only foreigners to enter the Shire were the\nDwarves travelling on the Great Road that ran through the Shire to and\nfrom their mines in the Blue Mountains, and the occasional elves in\nWandering Companies on their way to the Grey Havens. Despite this, two\nbattles were fought in the Shire, the Battle of Greenfields, and the\nBattle of Bywater. The Shire was also attacked by White Wolves in TA\n2911 during the Fell Winter, prompting the use of the Horn-call of\nBuckland.\n\nThe Shire derived its laws from the authority of the King at Fornost.\nAfter Fornost fell and the last king died, the Hobbits appointed a Thain\nto continue the authority of the missing king. The title of Thain\neventually passed to the head of the Took clan in Tuckborough. The Thain\ncommanded an armed force during emergencies, but otherwise had only a\nsymbolic role.\n\nThe Mayor of Michel Delving, elected once every 7 years, became the most\nimportant official in the Shire. Most hobbits regarded Michel Delving as\nthe principal town of the Shire, particularly with regard to its\ngovernment. The Mayor was also the Postmaster and the First Shirriff for\nthe whole Shire (also called the Mayor of the Shire ), and empowered to\nsummon a Shire-moot when the Shire is attacked.\n\nThe Master of Buckland at Bucklebury ruled over Buckland, though still\nsubject to the Thain and King of Gondor.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Shire was a small but beautiful and fertile land, beloved by its\ninhabitants. The Hobbits had an extensive agricultural system in the\nShire, but did not proceed with industrialization. Various supplies\ncould be found in the Shire, including cereals, fruit, wood and\npipe-weed (a favourite treat of Hobbits). Its relatively peaceful\nexistence during the perilous period preceding the defeat of Sauron can\nbe attributed to the vigilance of Gandalf and Rangers of the North led\nby Aragorn who used daring tactics to keep evil at bay. However when\nthese set out to a distant war, the Shire became essentially\ndefenceless, which led to its capture. But the damage which Saruman\ncaused by forced industrialization was undone by the Hobbits' efforts.\nThe Shire was restored with soil from Lórien, given to Sam by Galadriel.\nThe year SR 1420 was called _The Great Year of Plenty_ and was\nconsidered by the inhabitants of the Shire to be the most productive and\nprosperous year in their history.\n\nThe industrialization of the Shire may have been based on Tolkien's\nwitnessing of the extension of the Industrial Revolution to rural\nWarwickshire during his youth, and especially the deleterious\nconsequences thereof. The rebellion of the hobbits and the restoration\nof the pre-industrial Shire may be interpreted as a prescription of\nvoluntary simplicity as a remedy to the problems of modern society.\n\n\nMaps\n\n[Map of the Shire from _The Lord of the Rings Online_; Southfarthing not\nincluded] On J. R. R. Tolkien's maps, the Shire was located at about the\nsame position as England was on modern European maps and has been cited\nas an example of Deep England ideology (of course, England being on an\nisland while Shire is inside the continent). Throughout the narrative,\nTolkien also implies numerous points of similarity between the two, such\nas weather, agriculture and dialect. One can also see England as\nTolkien's source of inspiration for the shire in its very name (“Shire”\nis a synonym of “county” see: English Shire).\n\n\nNearby locations\n\n-   North: Hills of Evendim\n-   East: Bree\n-   South: Brandywine River\n-   West: White Downs, Grey Havens",

    "name": "Rhûn",
    "lotr_page_id": "880",
    "text": "RHÛN, also known as THE EAST and EASTLANDS in the Westron tongue, is a\nlarge region in the far eastern part of Middle-earth. It was the home\nand kingdom of the Easterlings in the Second and Third Ages. It had many\ndifferent groups who ultimately fought together and were in Sauron's\nservice.\n\nOverview\n\n“Rhûn” is a name used for all lands lying east of Rhovanion, around and\nbeyond the inland Sea of Rhûn, from where many attacks on Gondor and its\nallies came during the Third Age.\n\nWe know almost nothing of the lands beyond the great Sea of Rhûn that\nstood on its borders with the western lands. Even Gandalf had never\nexplored there, and although Aragorn visited once, his activities are\nnot recounted.\n\nOf its ancient geography we can glean a little from _The Silmarillion_;\nfar beyond the Sea of Rhûn was another inland sea, the Sea of Helcar,\nand beyond that a range of mountains known as the Orocarni (Red\nMountains). Somewhere in the lost east, too, lay Cuiviénen and\nHildórien, where Elves and Men first awoke: all the Children of Ilúvatar\ncould trace their ancestries back to the eastward regions of\nMiddle-earth.\n\nEasterlings were a race of Men of Darkness who were ready to follow both\nDark Lords and fought as their allies in war in different parts of\nhistory.\n\nDuring the Third Age, Rhûn was visited by three Wizards; Saruman,\nAlatar, and Pallando, and though Saruman returned to the west, the two\nBlue Wizards remained. Their fates are unknown and whether they were\nsuccessful in inspiring the peoples they had contact with to resist\nSauron's influence is unknown. Sauron himself journeyed into the\neastward lands, in hiding from the White Council during the centuries\nknown in the west as the Watchful Peace.\n\nThe land of Dorwinion lay in Rhûn, and the Easterlings of the Balchoth\nand Wainriders lived there.\n\nGondor conquered western edge of Rhûn twice: under the Kings Rómendacil\nI and Rómendacil II, but the Numenoreans never had full control over it.\n\nThe people of Rhûn were finally subdued in the Fourth Age under King\nElessar (Aragorn) and his son Eldarion. King Elessar eventually made\npeace with the Easterlings, and they were allowed to remain in Rhûn.\n\nTrade\n\nIt is possible that colossal quantities of ore and other critical raw\nmaterials were shipped from Rhûnic mines in the eastern territories and\nthe Orocarni mountain range to the Black Land.\n\nIn times of peace (or unstable lulls between Easterling attacks), the\nMen of Rhûn traded their products to their erstwhile enemies as well. As\nseen in ''The Hobbit, ''a number of Elvish guardsmen in the cellar of\nKing Thranduil's subterranean palace drank themselves into a stupor and\nblindly let Bilbo Baggins and his Dwarf companions escape down the River\nRunning to Lake-town. The massive, wild white Kine of Araw (from which\nBoromir's Horn of Gondor was crafted) would also prove to provide a\nsource of rare, sumptuous, and mouth-watering meat that was famed around\nthe land and was greatly desired by the monarchs of every sort of\nkingdom, from the Elvenking to the Steward of Gondor.\n\nGeography\n\nThe western part of Rhûn was given in maps of the Westlands of\nMiddle-earth. It contained the great Sea of Rhûn, connected the River\nRunning in the northwest. A forest lay to the north-east of the Sea, and\nnear the south-western shores, there were many hills. South-west of the\nSea of Rhûn lay also the land of Dorwinion.\n\nThe Inland Sea of Rhûn was located in western Rhûn on the border between\nRhûn and Wilderland. There were mountains on the southwest side of the\nSea of Rhûn and a forest on the north-east side. Wild white Kine of\nAraw, or oxen, lived near the shores of the Sea of Rhûn.\n\nFurther east in Rhûn were ancient regions where the Children of Ilúvatar\nfirst awoke: Cuiviénen for the Elves, which lay on the shores of Sea of\nHelcar near the Orocarni (Red Mountains); and Hildórien for Men. Four\nDwarven clans were also located in Rhûn (Orocarni); their mansions were\nat least as far east from Mount Gundabad in the Misty Mountains as Mount\nGundabad lay east of the Blue Mountains. Additionally, Sauron maintained\na fortress in Rhûn in the Third Age.\n\nThe Dwarves of Rhûn\n\nDwarves emerged in Middle-earth in the Years of the Trees: after Elves\nbut before Men. When the seven Fathers of the Dwarves awoke in far-flung\ncorners of Middle-earth, some of them found themselves in Rhûn, and\nthere they founded kingdoms under the mountains of Orocarni. The\nfollowing clans are the Houses that resided in the Orocarni: Ironfists,\nStiffbeards, Blacklocks, Stonefoots. In the Third Age, Dwarves of those\nkingdoms journeyed out of Rhûn to join all Middle-earth's other Dwarf\nclans in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which was fought in and under\nthe Misty Mountains. After this war, the survivors returned home. Late\nin the Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rhûn itself, considerable\nnumbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge\nin Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met Frodo Baggins.\n\nMilitary\n\nRhûn was known for numerous fighting forces, nearly spelling the doom of\nGondor and almost heralding Sauron's complete victory over the entirety\nof Middle-earth. (See the article entitled “Easterlings” for a complete\ndigest of their military structure.) However, we can assume that their\nmilitary was not of the quality of the three houses of the Edain.\nBecause of their distance from the high culture of the Eldar, their\nweaponry and armor would most likely be inferior to that of their Edain\nbrothers that were armed by the Elves of Beleriand. On their other hand,\ntheir work with Morgoth's Orcs would place them in a position to utilize\nhis weaponry after large losses and attrition.\n\nThe main weapon of the infantry of Rhûn that marched upon Gondor seemed\nto be the spear although there were reports of short, swarthy men\nwielding axes during Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nHowever, they are not all footmen. In the books, they are described as\nhaving bowmen upon horses and then they are described as companies of\nhorsemen. Both the Wainriders and the Balchoth also used chariots. These\nwere supremely effective in the flat no-man's lands that characterized\nmuch of Rhovanion in the wide corridor between the southern eaves of\nMirkwood and the northern flanks of Mordor, routing and destroying the\narmies of Gondor under King Narmacil II in the Battle of the Plains.\nThey were to take a considerable toll on the Eotheod as well.\n\nThe Easterlings that fought in the War of the Ring established and built\non the solid foundation of military excellence and fearsome savagery\nthat characterized their all-conquering ancestors. Often, the\nEasterlings in a mixed contingent of Orcs, Haradrim, Variags, Corsairs,\nor Uruk-hai would be the first to clash with the enemy and the last to\nleave the field. The Rhûnic tradition of bravery and self-sacrifice was\nimbued within every warrior of Rhûn, instilling him with a concoction of\nbloodlust and fury that would ensure that he fought to the last. As\nevidenced in countless battles during the Third Age, the Easterlings\nwould always stand their ground and fight to the last man unless ordered\notherwise. This was proven in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The\nEasterlings' resolve to fight to the death was also exemplified the next\nday when the tables turned against Sauron. While the host of Mordor\ndropped their weapons, shed their armor, and fled en masse across the\nbridge to Osgiliath, the host of the Easterlings halted with their backs\nto the River Anduin and stood their ground. None survived, despite\ninflicting numerous casualties upon their hated enemies.\n\nThe vast Rhûnic army that besieged Dale and the Lonely Mountains in TA\n3019 most likely had a sizable support element traveling along with\nthem, for one does not simply win a siege with footmen. It is likely\nthat the siege weapons brought along by the Easterlings differed greatly\nfrom their primitive and savage Orc allies.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Elves awoke far east of the Sea of Rhûn, and many of them were\nled to the Westlands by Oromë. Some Elves forsook this Great Journey and\nchose to remain in the east; they were called the Avari.\n\nThe first Men also awoke in the far east, where they first met Dwarves\nand Avari. The ancestors of the Edain and Drúedain traveled west out of\nRhûn. At the shores of the Sea of Rhûn, some of the Mannish tribes\ntraveling west separated and their languages soon diverged. Other men\nremained in Rhûn, and many of them came under the dominion of Morgoth\nand, later, Sauron. These men were called Easterlings, and they led many\nattacks against Gondor and its allies during the Third Age.\n\nThe most western parts of Rhûn were conquered by Gondor twice, under the\nKings Rómendacil I and Rómendacil II, but the Numenoreans never had full\ncontrol over it. Western Rhûn was finally subdued in the Fourth Age\nunder King Elessar and his son Eldarion.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Rhûn is Sindarin for 'east', as opposed to the Quenya _romen_.\nLikewise, Harad means 'south' in Sindarin, Forod means north, and Dûn\nmeans west.",

    "name": "Mordor",
    "lotr_page_id": "239",
    "text": "MORDOR was a black, volcanic plain located in the southeast of\nMiddle-earth to the East of Gondor, Ithilien and the great river\nAnduin. Mordor was chosen by Sauron to be his realm because of the\nmountain ranges surrounding it on three sides, creating a natural\nfortress against his enemies. Translated, it means, “Land of Darkness”\n\n\nGeography\n\n[]\n\nMordor was protected from three sides by large mountain ranges, arranged\nroughly in a rectangular manner: Ash Mountains in the north, Ephel Dúath\nin the west and south. In the northwest corner of Mordor the deep valley\nof Udûn was the only few entrance for large armies, and that is where\nSauron built the Black Gate of Mordor. In front of the Black Gate lay\nthe Dagorlad or the _Battle Plain_. Sauron's main fortress of Barad-dûr\nwas at the foothills of Ered Lithui. To the southwest of Barad-dûr lay\nthe arid plateau of Gorgoroth and Mount Doom; to the east lay the plain\nof Lithlad. Mordor's geography was excellent for defense against enemies\nattacking on all fronts, for nearly un-scalable mountains defended\nMordor on three sides, while the broken, jagged land of Gorgoroth and\nNúrn would greatly impede any army that managed to break through.\n\nMordor's dry and blasted geography would also be extremely unfriendly to\nany army bivouacked on the plains, forcing a withdrawal within days\n(unless they have stores sufficient for months). The only other path for\narmies to cross into Mordor from the west, over the Ephel Duath was the\nPass of Cirith Ungol. Isildur originally built the city of Minas Ithil (\n“Tower of the Rising Moon”) to guard this pass from evil things\nattempting to re-enter Mordor, but in the Third Age the population of\nthe city waned and was conquered by the Nazgûl. It became the home of\nthe Ringwraiths and was renamed Minas Morgul ( “the Tower of Sorcery”),\nand was thereafter a great stronghold of evil, ever at war with Gondor\nto the west, until the end of the War of the Ring. To escape the\nvigilance of Morgul, to enter Mordor one would still have to get past\nthe lair of Shelob, and the Tower of Cirith Ungol- a feat only Frodo\nBaggins and Samwise Gamgee (led by Gollum) ever accomplished- though not\nwithout being waylaid by the great fearsome spider Shelob, and Frodo\nbeing taken prisoner to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.\n\nThe southern part of Mordor called Núrn was slightly more fertile, and\nmoist enough to carry the inland Sea of Núrnen. Nurn was made somewhat\nfertile because the ash blown from Mount Doom left its soil\nnutrient-rich, thus allowing dry-land farming.\n\nTo the west of Mordor was the narrow land of Ithilien with the city of\nOsgiliath and the great river Anduin, while directly East of it was\nRhûn, and to the southeast, Khand.\n\n\n\nThe east of Mordor is by far the least mentioned of any of Mordor's\ngeographic notes and descriptions. One might assume that the easiest\nroute to Mount Doom would be for the Fellowship to journey through the\n'unguarded' section of the east, where no mountains guard; however, we\nare told in the ''Fellowship of the Ring ''that the area was heavily\ndefended by a line of border forts facing Sauron's allies in Rhûn. In\ntheory, these forts have no use, because to get there they would have to\npass along the western edge of Rhûn, and Sauron's strongest allies, the\nEasterlings, abode there. Also, it would have been difficult to pass\nunnoticed, because the many roads running from Mordor into Rhûn were\nalways being marched along by Easterlings entering Mordor or patrolling\nthe roads and borders.\n\nRegions\n\n-   Gorgoroth\n-   Lithlad\n-   Núrn\n-   Eastern Desolation\n\nMajor Fortresses\n\n-   Barad-dûr (Capital and seat of the Dark Lord Sauron.)\n-   Durthang\n-   Osgiliath (East bank, retaken by Gondorwhen led by Boromir, later\n    whole city is taken as part of the Witch-king's armies campaign to\n    take the city of Minas Tirith during the War of the Ring)\n-   Isenmouthe\n-   Minas Morgul (Home of the Nazgûl including the Witch-King, commander\n    of Mordor's armies and Sauron's second-in-command and the fell\n    captain)\n-   Black Gate\n-   Mount Doom (Oroduin, where Frodo cast the Ring and destroyed it)\n-   Nargroth\n-   Seregost\n-   Tower of Cirith Ungol\n\n \n\n\nFormation\n\nMordor was a relic of the devastating works of Morgoth, apparently\nformed by massive volcanic eruptions. It was given the name Mordor\nalready before Sauron settled there, because of its volcano Mount Doom\nand its eruptions. Sauron however was the first to settle there with the\nexception of Shelob and her ancestors.\n\nOne possible theory to Mordor's creation, based upon maps of\nMiddle-Earth in the First Age is that it maybe the dried seabed of the\nonce inland Sea of Helcar.\n\n\nLanguages and people\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Sauron had gathered great armies to\nserve him. These included enslaved Men of the East and the South, who\nspoke a variety of tongues, and Orcs and Trolls, who usually spoke a\ndebased form of the Common Speech. But within Barad-dûr and among the\ncaptains of Mordor (the Ringwraiths and other high-ranking servants such\nas the Mouth of Sauron), the Black Speech was still used, the language\ndevised by Sauron during the Dark Years of the Second Age. In addition\nto ordinary Orcs and Trolls, Sauron had bred a stronger strain of Orcs,\nthe Uruk-hai, and very large Trolls known as Olog-hai who could endure\nthe sun. The Olog-hai knew only the Black Speech\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly History\n\nSauron settled in Mordor 1,000 years after the end of the First Age, and\nit remained the pivot of his evil contemplations for the whole of the\nSecond and Third Ages of Middle-earth. In the north-western corner of\nthis land stood Mount Doom, where Sauron had forged the One Ring. Near\nOrodruin stood Sauron's stronghold Barad-dûr. After this time, Sauron\nwas known as the Dark Lord of Mordor. \n\n[Sauron looking over the Orc Army of Gorgoroth]\n\nFor two and a half thousand years, Sauron ruled Mordor uninterruptedly.\nHaving wrought the Ring, it was from there that he launched the attack\nupon the Elves of Eregion. He was repelled by the Men of Númenor. He\nfought against the men again, almost a thousand years later; that time,\nhe was captured by the Numenoreans and brought to their island kingdom,\neventually causing its destruction (see _Akallabêth_). Immediately after\nNúmenor's destruction, Sauron returned to Mordor as a spirit and resumed\nhis rule.\n\nThe Last Alliance and Third Age\n\n[The battle of the Siege of Barad-dûr]\n\nSauron's rule was interrupted yet again when his efforts to overthrow\nthe surviving Men and Elves failed, and they fought their way back to\ntheir foe's domain. After several years of siege, forces of the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men came into Mordor. Sauron was defeated in a\nfinal battle on the slopes of Mount Doom. For about a thousand years,\nMordor was guarded by Gondor in order to prevent any evil forces from\nbreaking out. Minas Ithil , The Towers of the Teeth and the Tower of\nCirith Ungol were built by Gondor to watch two of the major entry points\nto the dark land.\n\nHowever, Sauron eventually used the Wainriders to distract and weaken\nGondor, and the Nazgûl, after having destroyed Arnor reclaimed it and\nstarted to rebuild its might. Minas Ithil was conquered by the Nine\nRingwraiths and the Gondor fortresses occupied by evil creatures. By the\ntime Sauron returned into Mordor after his false defeat in Dol Guldur\n(in the events that took place at the time of Bilbo Baggins's quest),\nMordor was too strong to be captured by any military might that was\navailable in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. In the north of\nMordor during the War of the Ring were the great garrisons and forges of\nwar, while surrounding the bitter inland Sea of Núrnen to the south lay\nthe vast fields tended for the provision of the armies by hordes of\nslaves brought in from lands to the east and south.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n[Sauron's vast army crossing over Gorgoroth]\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered all his forces to Mordor.\nAfter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, a Host of the West went to the\nBlack Gate. Sauron sent his army to destroy the Men of Gondor and Rohan,\nbut then Frodo Baggins destroyed the One Ring and Mordor fell. The Eye\nof Sauron was destroyed, sending shock waves through the air and ground.\nThe Dark Tower of Barad-dûr, the Black Gate and the Towers of Teeth\ncollapsed to ruin. Mount Doom exploded and both Sauron and his\nRingwraiths were apparently destroyed. The shadows fled and the bright\nlight came and filled Mordor.\n\n\nNames and Styles\n\n_Mordor_ actually has two meanings: _THE BLACK LAND_ or _THE DARK LAND_\nin Tolkien's contrived language Sindarin, and _THE LAND OF SHADOW_ in\nQuenya. The root _mor_ (“dark”, “black”) also appears in Moria. _Dor_\n(“land”) also appears in _Gondor_ (“stone-land”) and _Doriath_ (“fenced\nland”). The Quenya word for Shadow is “mordo”. It is pronounced with a\nRussian-sounding _r_. The gate of Mordor, Morannon, means The Black\nGate. It was named this by the elves in the Second Age.\n\nA proposed etymology out of the context of Middle-earth is Old English\n_morthor_, which means “mortal sin” or “murder”. (The latter are\ndescended from the former.) It is not uncommon for names in Tolkien's\nfiction to have relevant meanings in several languages, both those\ninvented by Tolkien, and “real” ones, but this of course happens with\nany two languages. _Mordor_ is also a name cited in some Nordic\nmythologies referring to a land where its citizens practice evil without\nknowing it, imposed on themselves by the society long created for that\npurpose. This quite fits with Tolkien's Mordor.\n\nIn _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, Karen Wynn Fonstad assumes that the\nlands of Mordor, Khand, and Rhûn lay where the inland Sea of Helcar had\nbeen, and that the Sea of Rhûn and Sea of Núrnen were its remnants. The\natlas was published before ''The Peoples of Middle-earth ''however, in\nwhich it turns out that the Sea of Rhûn and Mordor already did exist in\nthe First Age.",

    "text": "NÚMENOR was a great kingdom of Men, established on an island brought up\nout of the sea by the Valar in the early Second Age after the final ruin\nof Beleriand, and was where the Númenoreans originated from.\n\nThe name is from the Quenya _NÚMENÓRË_: “West-land”, which Tolkien\ntranslated as _WESTERNESSE_ (which was _ANADÛNÊ_ in the Númenórean\nlanguage).\n\n\nHistory\n\nNúmenor was the kingdom of the Numenoreans and subsequently\nthe Dúnedain, located on an island in the Great Sea, between\nMiddle-earth and Aman. The land was brought up from the sea as a gift\nto Men. It was also called ''ELENNA_ or the _ISLE OF\nELENNA'' (“STARWARDS”) because the Dunedain were led to it by the star\nof Eärendil, and because the island was in the shape of a five-pointed\nstar. At the center of the island the mountain Meneltarma was used by\nthe Dunedain as a temple to Ilúvatar. The largest city and capital of\nNúmenor was Armenelos. After the great war with the Dark Lord Morgoth,\nthe Valar took pity on the House of Bëor for their sufferings.\n\nNúmenor had only two rivers: Siril, which began at Meneltarma and ended\nin a small delta near the city of Nindamos, and the Nunduinë, which\nreached the sea in the Bay of Eldanna near the haven Eldalondë.\n\nElros son of Eärendil was the first King of Númenor, taking the name\nof Tar-Minyatur (“First King”). Under his rule (year SA 32 to SA 442 of\nthe Second Age), and those of his descendants, Men rose to become a\npowerful race. The first ships sailed from Númenor to Middle-earth in\nthe year SA 600 of the Second Age.\n\nThe Numenoreans were forbidden by the Valar from sailing so far westward\nthat Númenor was no longer visible, for fear that they would come upon\nthe Undying Lands, to which men could not come.\n\nDecline of Númenor\n\nOver time the Numenoreans came to resent the Ban of the Valar and to\nrebel against their authority, seeking the everlasting life that they\nbelieved was begrudged them. They tried to compensate this by going\neastward and colonizing large parts of Middle-earth, first in a friendly\nway, but later as tyrants. Soon the Numenoreans came to rule a great but\nterrorizing maritime empire that had no rival, but a few (the Faithful)\nremained loyal to the Valar and friendly to the elves.\n\nBut in Middle-earth in the year SA 1600 the Dark Lord Sauron (former\nservant of Morgoth), enemy of the Valar, deceived the Elven smiths\nof Eregion and forged a master ring. By SA 1693, the Elves and Sauron\nwere at war and in SA 1699 the Elves were overrun. Númenor took notice\nand Tar-Minastir, King of Númenor sent a fleet to save Lindon and by SA\n1701 Eriador was reconquered. Around SA 1800 Númenoreans started\nsettling on the coast of Middle-earth in places such as Umbar. But\nSauron extended his power and his shadow fell on Númenor.\n\nIn the year SA 3255, the 25th king Ar-Pharazôn sailed to Middle-earth.\nThe Númenoreans came in such force, that Sauron himself, surrendered to\ntheir might. Sauron then poisoned the mind of the King and soon\ncorrupted the Numenoreans, promising them eternal life if they\nworshiped Morgoth. With Sauron as his advisor, Ar-Pharazôn had a 500\nfoot tall temple to Morgoth erected in which he offered human\nsacrifices.\n\nDuring this time, the white tree Nimloth the Fair, whose fate was said\nto be tied to the line of kings, was cut down and burned as a sacrifice\nto Morgoth. Isildur rescued a fruit of the tree which grew to become\nthe White Tree of Gondor, preserving the ancient line of trees.\n\nPrompted by Sauron and fearing death and old age, Ar-Pharazôn built a\ngreat armada and set sail into the west to make war upon the Valar and\nseize the Undying Lands (Sauron remained behind). In the year SA 3319 of\nthe Second Age, Ar-Pharazôn landed on Aman and marched to the city\nof Valimar. Manwë, chief of the angelic Valar, called upon Ilúvatar, who\nbroke and changed the world, trapping Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host\nwho landed on Aman in mounds of dirt and inside the Caves of the\nForgotten until the last battle, taking Aman and Tol Eressëa from the\nspheres of Arda forever, changing the world's shape from flat to round\nand sinking Númenor and killing its inhabitants, including the body of\nSauron who was thereby robbed of his ability to assume fair and charming\nforms.\n\n\n\nElendil, son of the leader of the Faithful during the reign of\nAr-Pharazôn, his sons and his followers had been warned of the disaster\nthat was to befall Númenor, and they had set sail in nine ships before\nthe island fell. They landed in Middle-earth, and founded the kingdoms\nof Arnor and Gondor.\n\nAfter its fall Númenor was called _ATALANTË_, MEANING \"THE DOWNFALLEN\",\nIN THE QUENYA LANGUAGE. (THE SIMILARITY WITH ATLANTIS IS OBVIOUS,\nALTHOUGH TOLKIEN DESCRIBED HIS INVENTION OF THE NAME AS A HAPPY ACCIDENT\nWHEN HE REALISED THAT THE QUENYA ROOT MEANING \"FALLEN\" COULD BE\nINCORPORATED INTO A NAME REFERRING TO NÚMENOR.) OTHER NAMES AFTER THE\nDOWNFALL INCLUDE _MAR-NU-FALMAR_ (\"LAND UNDER THE WAVES\")\nAND _AKALLABÊTH_ (“the Downfallen” in Adûnaic).\n\nThe story of the rise and downfall of Númenor is told in the Akallabêth.\n\nIt is unknown what will happen to Númenor in the future; whether it will\nremain forever under the sea or, like Beleriand, it will be recovered,\nas suggested by the final words of Galadriel to Treebeard at their\nparting at Isengard: “Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie\nunder the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads\nof Nan-Tathren we may meet in the spring. Farewell!”. It is possible\nthat after the Dagor Dagorath, when the world will be broken and a new\none will be created, Númenor will then be recovered.\n\n\nOf the Numenoreans\n\nThe population of Númenor chiefly consisted of Men of the surviving\nhouses of the Edain, and they were known as the _Númenóreans_, or\nrather, _Kings among Men_. They had been increased in body and mind by\nEönwë at the end of the War of Wrath, and granted a lifespan of an\naverage 200 years, much increased from their ancestors' lifespan of 90\nyears. Those of the royal house descended from the first Half-elven\nking, Elros Tar-Minyatur, however, were given a lifespan of more than\n300 years. These included the Lords of Andúnië and the Kings and Queens\nof Númenor.\n\nBefore the Shadow fell on the island, the westernmost cities such as\nAndúnië contained a small population of Elves because of their frequent\nvisits from the isle of Tol Eressëa.\n\nThe Numenoreans were extremely skilled in arts and craft, and in the\nforging of weapons and armour; but before the fall of the Shadow, they\nwere not warmongers, hence the chief art on the island became that of\nshipbuilding and sea-craft. The Numenoreans became great mariners,\nexploring the world in all directions save for the westward, where the\nBan of the Valar was in force. They often travelled to the shores of\nMiddle-earth, teaching the men their art and craft, and introduced\nfarming so as to improve their everyday lives. When the Shadow fell,\nhowever, the Numenoreans became more unneighbourly with the Men of\nMiddle-earth. They levied heavy tribute from them and returned to\nNúmenór with ships filled with spoil.\n\nThe Numenoreans became skilled in the art of husbandry also, breeding\ngreat horses that roamed across the open plains in Mittalmar. Although\nthe Numenoreans were originally a peaceful people, their weapons, armor,\nand horse-riding skills could not be contested by anyone in Arda, save\nfor the Valar.\n\n\nGeography\n\nNúmenor was a rather large island in the middle of the Western Sea. The\nisland itself was in the shape of a 5-point star, each point having its\nown unique geological and physical features. Each point, therefore, was\nconsidered a separate region of Númenor and had separate names:\n\n-   Forostar (_Northlands_)\n-   Andustar (_Westlands_)\n-   Hyarnustar (_Southwestlands_)\n-   Hyarrostar (_Southeastlands_)\n-   Orrostar (_Eastlands_)\n-   Mittalmar (_Inlands_)\n\nThe island had a mountain in the centre known as Meneltarma. Meneltarma\nwas the highest location on the entire island and was considered sacred\nby the Numenoreans as a shrine of God, Eru Ilúvatar. Only the Kings of\nNúmenor were allowed to speak on the summit. It was said that on a clear\nday, Tol Eressëa, an island on the outer shores of Valinor, could be\nseen from the summit.\n\nMeneltarma itself was a tall mountain in the centre of the island (in\nthe region of Mittalmar) that, when translated, means _Pillar of the\nHeavens_. The lower slopes of the mountain were gentle and\ngrass-covered; however, near the summit the slopes became more vertical\nand could not be ascended easily. The kings later built a spiraling road\nto the peak, beginning at the southern tip of the mountain and winding\nup to the lip of the summit in the north. The summit, however, was\nunique in that it was flattened and somewhat depressed, and was said to\nbe able to “contain a great multitude”. It was considered the most\nsacred spot of Númenor; no one ever set foot there and nothing was ever\nbuilt there throughout the entire history of the island.\n\nThe island itself was tilted southward and a little westward; the\nsouthern coasts were all steep sea cliffs.\n\n\nThe Flora\n\nNúmenor contained many species of plants that could be found nowhere\nelse in Middle-earth, for many of them were given to the Numenoreans\nfrom the Valar in Aman. Most important of these was the White Tree that\ndwelt in the King's Palace at Armenelos; it was the symbol of Men\nthereafter, in Númenor, Arnor, and Gondor.\n\nThe other parts of Númenor contained many types of plants, many unique\nto each of the promontories of the island. Andustar contained great\nforests of beech and birch at higher altitudes, and oak and elm forests\non the lower.\n\nThe greatest delight of the Numenoreans, however, were the flowers given\nto them by the Eldar. They grew mostly in the Western portion\n(Andustar). They are oft remembered in poems and lore, and few have\nflowered east of Númenor.\n\nBecause of the diversity of evergreen and sweet-smelling plants in\nAndustar, it was soon called Nisimaldar, meaning _Fragrant Trees_. Also\nonly in Andustar could the Golden Trees known as the Mallorn grow.\n\nIn Hyarrostar grew the Laurinquë tree, which the Númenorans loved\nbecause of their flowers. They believed that it came from the Great Tree\nof Valinor, Laurelin.",

    "text": "DORIATH (Sindarin IPA: ) (aka ARTANOR\") was an Elven realm, the land\nof the Sindar that existed during the latter-half of the Years of the\nTrees and most of the First Age of the Sun. For thousands of years it\nwas separate from the outside world under the rule of King Thingol and\nthe protection of his wife Melian the Maia, until it was drawn into the\nwar against Morgoth and the doom that lay on the Ñoldor, because of the\nOath of Fëanor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nDoriath was located in the middle of Beleriand, between Ered Gorgoroth\n(Mountains of Terror) from the north and the Andram from south, and\nTalath Dirnen from the west, and Estolad from the east. It was a realm\nof forests about the great river Sirion; within it were the forests\n_Neldoreth_ (also _Taur-na-Neldor_, the northern beech forest), _Nivrim_\n(also West-march, an oak forest), and _Region_ (pronounced Reh-gi-on,\nthe main forest). Additionally, the forests of _Brethil_ and ''Nan\nElmoth ''were considered to be under the influence of Thingol, though\nnot under his direct command and laying outside of the Girdle of Melian.\nEöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid with the\nsword Anglachel. The People of Haleth, or the Haladin, lived in Brethil\nwith the permission of Thingol. They governed themselves, but cooperated\nwith the march-wardens of Doriath. King Elu Thingol of Doriath, also\nHigh King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the\nGelion to the Belegaer (the Sea).\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had\nbeen ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then\ntheir lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when Ulmo returned for them,\na part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves,\nand when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.\n\nThe forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in the center of\nBeleriand, and were the abode of King Thingol and Melian. Their people\nwere the people of the Teleri who did not heed the call of the Valar to\npass over the sea to Valinor. All the Elves of Beleriand, from the\nshipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to the hunters of the Blue\nMountains, held Thingol as their lord. During the First and Second Ages\nof the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by the end\nof the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol\ncalled on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a\ncity-fortress for the protection of his people. They also helped make\nfor them a store of stronger and better weapons that were better able to\ndeal with the Orcs of north. This was built under ground along the\nsouthern side of the River Esgalduin, and was called Menegroth, which\nbecame Thingol's capital.\n\nFor the most part, the Elves lived in scattered bands throughout\nBeleriand, only gathering in larger numbers in Neldoreth and Region\n(together called Eglador), and along the Falas. During the Third Age of\nthe Chaining of Melkor, Thingol proceeded to arm his people with the aid\nof the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost against the continued foreboding\nof Melian.\n\nAfter Melkor's release, his attack on the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and\nflight to Middle-earth, the situation for Beleriand suddenly worsened.\nUngoliant fled south from the Balrogs after her confrontation with\nMelkor, now Morgoth, and was only checked by the power of Melian. Some\ntime after, the forces of Morgoth left the freshly delved Angband and\nassaulted Beleriand from east and west in the First Battle of Beleriand.\nIn the east, King Thingol lead the forces of Beleriand, with the aid of\nDenethor and his Nandor and elves from Ossiriand, and completely\ndefeated the Orcs of the eastern army. Denethor was killed on Amon Ereb,\nand some of his people merged themselves to the Sindarin Elves under\nKing Thingol. Upon returning to Menegroth, Thingol learned that the\nwestern army of Morgoth had overrun the Falas. Thingol recalls all of\nhis people he can into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian puts forth her\npower and rings the region in a girdle of enchantment called the Girdle\nof Melian. At that point, the region formally called Eglador comes to be\nformally known as Doriath, the Guarded Kingdom.\n\nThe First Battle is the only time King Thingol leads his forces into\nbattle outside of his realm for the entirety of the First Age of the\nSun. Afterwards, the Elves of Doriath fight defensively, guarding their\nborders and the important river crossings nearby.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nWhen the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First\nAge, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the\nchildren of Finarfin, who were related to him by his brother Olwë.\n\nWhen later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but\nat Finrod's request the Haladin gives his permission for the People of\nHaleth to dwell in Brethil, who ally themselves with Doriath and aid\nthem in its defense.\n\nThroughout the rest of the First Age, while the Noldor fight their wars\nwith Morgoth, Doriath stands inviolate and generally aloof, refusing to\ntake part in the wars. Ultimately, however, King Thingol is pulled into\nthe doom surround the Noldor as was told in the Lay of Leithian, when\nBeren, son of Barahir and lord of the First House of Men, passed through\nthe Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth.\n\nRealizing that his beloved daughter Lúthien had fallen in love with him,\nKing Thingol decreed that he would not allow them to marry unless Beren\nwould undertake a quest to recover a Silmaril from the Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and so begins the Quest for the Silmarils. After the Quest for\nthe Silmaril, the Wolf Carcharoth also breached the Girdle, but Thingol,\nBeren, and Thingol's captains Beleg and Mablung hunted and killed the\nbeast.\n\nAt the end of this, Thingol ended up in possession of one of the\nSilmarils. Beren and Lúthien, wedded together by fate and returning from\nthe dead, left Doriath to live in Ossiriand. After the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, only three elven kingdoms remained: Nargothrond, Gondolin,\nand Doriath. Nargothrond fell soon after, as told in the _Narn i Chîn\nHúrin_ (Tale of the Children of Hurin).\n\nFearing that the cruel Easterlings would enthrall her only\nson Túrin of Hithlum, Morwen sent him to Doriath where he would be safe\nuntil he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and\nsister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.\n\nHurin, captured at the Nirnaeth and released from Angband after the\ndeath of his son Turin, recovers the Nauglamir from the ruin of\nNargothrond. Traveling to Doriath, he throws it at the feet of Thingol\nin spite. Melian rebukes him, and Hurin, cured of the madness of Morgoth\nby Melian, lifts up the Nauglamir and presents it to Thingol before\nleaving Doriath, and vanishing from history.\n\nFall of Doriath\n\nHúrin brought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of\nFinrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine\nthe Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamir, the Dwarves'\nNecklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol and slew him, stealing the\nnecklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with\nher, the protective Girdle thus ended the bliss of old that reigned in\nDoriath for thousands of years, and things would never be the same\nagain.\n\nThingol, in possession of the greatest work of the Elves (a Silmaril of\nFëanor) and Dwarves (the Nauglamir) decides to merge the two. He\nconvinces a large company of smiths from Nogrod to attempt to remake the\nNauglamir to incorporate the Silmaril, which they succeed in doing. Once\nthe work is complete, and the joint works of Elves and Dwarves sits\nglittering before Thingol, he moves to take it and put it on. The\nDwarves stop him, demanding it in payment. Thingol rebukes them with\nhaughty words, at which the Dwarves slay him. The Dwarves attempt to\nescape Doriath, but most are killed and the Nauglamir recovered. After\nThingol's death, Melian departs Doriath in grief and withdraws her power\nfrom Doriath. After telling Mablung to send word to Beren, she vanishes\nfrom Middle-earth and returns to Valinor. Doriath now lies\nundefended.\n\nTwo Dwarves return from Doriath and tell a twisted version of the events\nto their king in Nogrod. The Dwarves of Nogrod raise an army and assault\nDoriath in retaliation. The slaughter is great on both sides, but the\nDwarves end up victorious. Menegroth is ransacked, many of its people\nare killed, and the Dwarves begin the long trek for home laden with the\nspoils of war, including the Nauglamir. At Sarn Athrad, they are\nassaulted by a force of Green Elves led by Beren who, with the aid of\nthe Ents of Ossiriand, annihilate the Dwarven force and recover the\nSilmaril.\n\nDior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien and heir to Thingol, returns to\nDoriath with his wife Nimloth, their two sons Eluréd and Elurín, and\ntheir daughter Elwing. He begins to rebuild the fortunes of the kingdom\nand it is briefly restored. Beren takes the Nauglamir to Lúthien, who\nwears it, enriching their home on Tol Galen. However, Beren and Lúthien\nsoon die for the second time, leaving the world forever. The Nauglamir\nand its Silmaril are brought to Dior.\n\nSoon after, the Sons of Fëanor, following the Oath, demand the return of\nthe Silmaril. Dior refuses, and the Sons of Fëanor invade Doriath, at\nwhich point the Second Kinslaying occurs. Celegorm, Curufin, and\nCaranthir are killed, as is Dior, Nimloth, and Eluréd and Elurín. The\npeople of Doriath are killed or scattered, with Elwing taking the\nNauglamir and fleeing with a remnant of the people of Doriath to the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\nDoriath was never rebuilt and afterwards Doriath remained abandoned and\nunpopulated until it was sunk along with most of the rest of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Doriath_ means “Land of the Fence”, from _dôr_ (“land”)\nand _iâth_ (“fence”). Its previous name _EGLADOR_ either means “Land of\nthe Forsaken” or “Land of the Elves”, because the inhabitants called\nthemselves “Eglath”. The High Elves called Doriath the “Land of the\nCave”, from the Ñoldorin _gath_ or _gatta_ (“cavern”)\n\n_GARTHÚRIAN_ was name ascribed to the land of Doriath in earlier\nversions of the accounts of the First Age (specifically in _The War of\nthe Jewels_)_._",

    "text": "GONDOR was the prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by\nRohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea\nto the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath,\nmoved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the\ncapital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the\nFourth Age; other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and\nOsgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin.\n\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from\nNúmenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king\nchieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor was\nfrom Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years\ndue to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed.\nHowever, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a\ndevastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the\nThird Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II\nElessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded,\nuntil the former lands of Arnor were brought under the banner of the\nReunited Kingdom. \n\nIn all, there were thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was\nslain before Barad-dûr at the Siege of Barad-dûr. \n\n\nHistory\n\nLike Arnor to the north, Gondor was a Mannish kingdom founded by\nAnárion, the youngest son of Elendil, after the Downfall of Númenor. It\nwas located to the South of Rohan and to the West of Mordor, on the Bay\nof Belfalas.\n\nEarly years\n\n Before the Downfall of Númenor,\nGondor was home to many Númenórean colonists, who either mixed blood\nwith the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them\ninto Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. Gondor, at a latitude\ncomparable to Venice, was a more fertile region than Arnor to the north,\nand therefore it already had a larger population before the ships of\nElendil's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.\n\nThe Faithful or Elendili from Númenor were given a warm reception upon\ntheir arrival by those that had already colonized Middle-earth,\nincluding a colonial branch of Númenorean royalty at Dor-en-Ernil. The\ncolonists north of Anduin accepted Elendil's claim to kingship over\nthem. South of the Great River, however, the newly exiled Númenoreans\ndid not recognize Elendil's claim.\n\nGondor was being founded after Númenor's population had already split\nbetween The Faithful and King's Men, and all of the more southern\ncolonies (such as Umbar) remained enemies of The Faithful.\n\nThe newly founded kingdom of Gondor was then part of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very\nend of the Second Age, and when Isildur cut the finger of Sauron.\n\nGondor Prospers\n\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted\nby an Easterling invasion in TA 492). Its power would continue to grow\ninto the 9th century Third Age. While the power of Gondor's sister\nkingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various\nsuccessor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's\ngreat cities Minas Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir only grew\nand the Dunedain of Gondor started to rule over more and more of the\nlesser people.\n\nGondor's Golden Age\n\n\n\nGondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-kings”:\n\n-   Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913. First of the Ship-Kings, died\n    childless\n-   Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936. Nephew of Tarannon\n-   Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015\n-   Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149. Last of the\n    Ship-Kings. In the reign of the powerful king, Hyarmendacil I (c.\n    12th century TA) Gondor reached the height of its power. During\n    Hyarmendacil's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest\n    extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the\n    nearest lands of the Haradrim, as far north as Mirkwood, and west\n    towards the borders of Arnor.\n\nSuch was Gondor's wealth during the period that men from other lands\nwould say in envy: “In Gondor precious stones are but pebbles for the\nchildren to play with.” Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of\npeace due to its military might.\n\n\n\nThe Decline of Gondor\n\nHowever, after decadence spread under the Kings of Gondor and a long\nperiod of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals).\nThree great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the\nThird Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline: the\nKin-strife, the Great Plague, and the invasion of the Wainriders (a\ntribe of Easterlings).\n\nThe Kin-strife\n\nIn the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the\nnation apart. The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother\nwas of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of\nKing Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces\nwho possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and he fled\nnorth. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the Usurper. During his\nten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of\nhis old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the\ninterior provinces were ignored and left to rot. Eldacar then returned\nwith an army of his Northman kinsmen, and the armies of the Men of\nGondor joined them from interior provinces such as Anórien. Osgiliath\nwas devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its\n_Palantír_ lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but\nCastamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great\nport of Gondor. They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined\nwith the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their\ndescendants died out.\n\nThe Great Plague\n\nLater, the Great Plague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was\nno localized event: the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth,\nreaching the successor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in\nthe North. King Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved\nthe capital from Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During\nthis time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding\nagainst the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned. It is believed\nthat had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at\nthis time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondor's\nenemies in no better condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was\ncapable of mounting new offensives.\n\nThe Invasion of the Wainriders\n\nFollowing the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague, it did recover\nbut then the Wainrider (Easterlings) invaded and devastated Gondor, and\nthe conflict lasted for almost a century. The Wainriders destroyed the\nNorthern Army of Gondor, but survivors linked up with the victorious\nSouthern Army of Gondor which destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the\nriver Poros, led by a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the\nWainriders as they celebrated their victory during the Battle of the\nCamp.\n\nThe Line of the Kings Fails\n\nReunification Rejected\n\nIn TA 1944 Gondor faced a succession crisis when King Ondoher was slain\nin battle with both his sons. Arvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's\nson-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant\nblood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay\nmainly in the reintroduction of the old Nùmenorean law of accession,\nwhich stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If\nthe law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter\nand last remaining child, would become Ruling-Queen, making their\ndescendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put\nweight behind his claim, as he was Isildur's heir. The council of Gondor\nrecognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but\nthey dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of\nAnarion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a\nmillennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of\nboth Isildur and Anarion.\n\nEärnil laid his claim as being a direct descendant of King Telumehtar\nUmbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he\nhad gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the\nWainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward\nPelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of\nsuccession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who\nwould rule as Eärnil II.\n\nThe Last Heir of Anárion\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's\nforces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the\nLord of the Nazgûl. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse\nwas terrified and fled the battle against his wishes. By the time, he\nmastered his horse and returned the Witch-king had fled. Glorfindel the\nElf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord\nof the Nazgûl because “never by the hand of man shall he fall”.\n\nEärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (“Tower of\nthe Sun”). During this time, the Ringwraiths captured the city of Minas\nIthil (“Tower of the Moon”), renaming it _Minas Morgul_ (“Tower of Dark\nSorcery”) and taking it as their lair. Minas Anor was renamed _Minas\nTirith_ (Tower of Guard) as a result. The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly\nsent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat,\ntaunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during\nthe Battle of Fornost. Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and\nrode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the\nchallenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the Line of\nAnárion.\n\nThe Stewards of Gondor\n\nThe Ruling Stewards\n\nA long line of hereditary Stewards governed the realm after the\ndisappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that\nthe last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be\naccepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed,\nand Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would\nsurely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would\nswear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only\nan heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor, there was no\none who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the\nnorthern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not\nconsidered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without\nhaving the title. During the War of the Ring, the ruling Steward of\nGondor was Denethor II, and his two sons were Boromir and younger\nFaramir- the latter being the last Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nCirion and Eorl\n\nIn TA 2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one\nof its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the _Balchoth_ invaded\nGondor with mass force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but\nwere cut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the\nLimlight.\n\nMessengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe, which lived\nin the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the messengers\nto reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor,\nhowever, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field of\nCelebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of\nCalenardhon north of the White Mountains from the Gap of Rohan at the\nsouthern end of the Hithaeglir, Fangorn forest, rivers Limlight to\nAnduin, western Emyn Muil, and the Mering Stream, where they established\nthe kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A\npermanent alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath\nEorl swore to Cirion.\n\nThe War of the Ring and the Restoration\n\nSeveral centuries later, Sauron had prepared for the final conquest, and\nin TA 3018 his forces overran Ithilien. The attack was stopped at\nOsgiliath with the destruction of the bridge across the Anduin. The\nfollowing year Minas Tirith faced a larger attack from Mordor, with\nadditional threat from the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn summoned the Dead\nMen of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing forces in the\nsouth of Gondor to come to the aid of Minas Tirith. Gondor then defeated\nthe army of Mordor with the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West\nthen carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint\nto distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the\nOne Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the\nallies' ultimate victory.\n\nAfter the second and final defeat of Sauron, the Kingship was restored,\nwith Aragorn crowned as King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor\nand Gondor. Faramir, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, retained his\noffice as the Steward to the King, and ruled over Gondor's eastern\nregion of Ithilien; a fair land between the river Anduin and the Ephel\nDúath. The oaths between Gondor and Rohan were renewed, and several\njoint campaigns were fought in the east and south against the remnant of\nthe Easterlings and Haradrim; all former territories of the\nSouth-kingdom were won back during the following centuries, and its\npower and wealth were restored. Several Tolkien's writings state that\n_“...of Eldarion son of Elessar it was foretold that he should rule a\ngreat realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of men\nafter him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from\nhim should come the kings of many realms in long days after”_.\n\n\nArmies\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe soldiers of Gondor were renowned during the Second Age for their\nskill and valour. Training men of Gondor during the Second Age instilled\nwithin their soldiers a martial spirit and ardor, goading them to fight\nto the death against the hordes of Mordor, Rhûn, and Harad. Every man\nwas physically imposing: being very tall at over six feet, very broad,\nand very strong as well. Every single soldier was in peak fighting\ncondition and ready to fight against Sauron's hordes (especially during\nthe War of the Last Alliance). The three major weapons they used were\nspears, longswords, and longbows. They also knew how to form cohesive\nbox-formations, which were sturdy enough for both offensive and\ndefensive purposes. The soldiers wore heavy plate armour and utilised\nlarge shields made out of multi-layered wood and edged in metal for\nreinforcement.\n\nThird Age\n\nGondor's armies prevented Mordor and its allies from overwhelming the\nrest of Middle-earth. Gondor was in a very crucial position, in order to\nguard Middle Earth and because of Gondor's proximity to Mordor, its\nmilitary forces had to be proficiently trained and vigilantly on guard\nat all times. Because of this, they were arguably the strongest country\nthat opposed Sauron. During the Third Age, most of Minas Tirith's armies\nwere trained and drilled to fight in tight infantry formations,\nsupported by archers and cavalry. Their armaments consisted of a\nchainmail undercoat with either a black tabard or plate armor over it.\nTheir standard weapons were long spears, longswords, and longbows,\ncomplimented by tower shields. \n\nMinas Tirith's immediate defenses comprised thousands of infantrymen\nstationed throughout Osgiliath, Cair Andros, and the Rammas Echor. These\nunits were most likely temporary detachments from the city. Minas Tirith\nalso had at least three companies of the elite Guards of the Citadel,\ntasked to defend the upper levels of the city. They wore black robes,\nsurcoats and winged silver crowns. The Guards of the City were not\nallowed to go in the main part of the City in their uniform.\nAdditionally, the sixth level of the city housed stables for a small\nforce of horsemen. Beyond Anduin and the defenses of Minas Tirith\noperated a secretive group of soldiers called the Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien had guerrilla warfare aginst the Southrons,\nallies of Mordor. Similar to the Rangers of the North, the Rangers of\nIthilien were comprised of the remnant of the Dunedain in their\nrespective Kingdom, in this case being the Dunedain that once dwelled in\nIthilien.(the Rangers of the North were Arnorian Dunedain, while the\nRangers of Ithilien are Gondorian- and were more populous than their\nnorthern kin).  Armed with longbows, swords, and spears, these men\nwatched and harassed the enemy throughout Ithilien, much akin to\nguerrilla warfare. The captain of the Rangers of Ithilien during the War\nof the Ring was Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir and the son of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Denethor II.\n\nThe defense of Gondor's fiefdoms were the responsibility of the\nrespective lords of these territories. Their training, strength in\nnumbers, and armaments varied from each fief (Lossarnach brought axemen\nto the aid of Minas Tirith while the men of Morthond Vale consisted of\narchers). The greatest of these fiefs was Dol Amroth, which brought\nforth the largest force to Minas Tirith, made up of men-at-arms and\narguably the best cavalry in Middle Earth- the elite Swan Knights.\n\nGondor's fleet at the time of the War of the Ring was docked at\nPelargir. This port and the Anduin River was essential in the defense of\nMinas Tirith. As made evident by the fiefdom's dire need to defend their\ncoasts and many rivers of Gondor, a majority of the fleet was\nconcentrated at Pelargir. This fleet was destroyed when the Black Ships\nof Umbar attacked, enslaving many of Gondor's sailors into the service\nof Mordor.\n\n\nSong of Gondor\n\n_Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!_\n\n_West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree_\n\n_Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old._\n\n_O proud walls! White towers! O wingéd crown and throne of gold!_\n\n''O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, ''\n\n_Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?_\n\nThis was sung by Aragorn on his trip with Legolas and Gimli to find\nPippin and Merry.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Gondor_ name means 'Land of Stone', from Sindarin GOND (stone) + (N)DOR\n(land), most likely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered\nNimrais) and other mountain chains in the land (hypothetical Quenya name\nONDONÓRË).\n\n\nRegions of Gondor\n\n  Gondor was divided between several nearly\nautonomous regions. These were the following:\n\n-   Ithilien, a region along the east bank of the Anduin river under the\n    shadow of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Ithilien was\n    abandoned and mostly under the control of Mordor during The War of\n    the Ring. (Although Gondor did have secret bases throughout the\n    region such as Henneth Annûn, and the Rangers of Ithilien used\n    guerilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy throughout Ithilien,\n    and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from Mordor.\n    After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Lord Paramount of\n    Ithilien by Aragorn.\n-   South Ithilien, a portion of the the Ithilien south of Osgiliath.\n    The road (the Harad Road) the Southrons took to get to Morder lied\n    here.\n-   Anórien, a strip of land along the northern edge of the White\n    Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Rohan to the west,\n    Anduin to the east, the Mouths of Entwash to to the north, and\n    theWhite Mountainsand Rammas Echor to the south.\n-   Lossarnach, a heavily-populated farmland region southwest of Minas\n    Tirith.\n-   Lebennin, a plain extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay\n    of Belfalas that bordered Lossarnach.\n-   Belfalas, a fiefdom ruled by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Dor-en-Ernil, a narrow strip of land along the Bay of Belfalas ruled\n    by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Lamedon, a plain between the White Mountains and the River Ringló.\n-   Anfalas or _Langstrand_, a narrow strip of land along the sea\n    bordered by the Pinnath Gelin.\n-   Andrast, The western-most province of Gondor located on a narrow\n    peninsula jutting out into the Sea.\n-   Ringló Vale, a mini-province.\n-   Morthond or Blackroot Vale, where Duilin comes from.\n\nThe long cape of Andrast was not populated (by the descendants of\nNúmenóreans, but evidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a\nsmall group of Púkel-men inhabited it.)\n\nAdditionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain\npoints in its history:\n\n-   South Gondor or Harondor, an arid region between the rivers Porosand\n    Harnen, which was contested between Gondor and Harad.\n-   Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan. It's\n    boundaries were the rivers of Anduin in the east, Isenin the west,\n    Limlightin the north, and the White Mountains/ Mering Stream in the\n    south.\n-   Enedwaith, a region between the rivers Isen and Greyflood. It was\n    never truly populated by Gondor and was soon abandoned.\n-   Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control of Gondor but\n    under Gondorian control at certain times during the Third Age.\n-   Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, which was the extreme eastern\n    region of Gondor where she kept watch over Mordor with many\n    fortresses and cities such as Minas Ithil, Durthang, and the Tower\n    of Cirith Ungol. Evil things re-entered Mordor after Gondor's watch\n    upon the land slackened during the Second Age.\n\n\nMajor Sites\n\n Cities, Fortresses, and Strongholds in Gondor included:\n\n-   Cair Andros, an island-fortress in the river Anduin, roughly 40\n    miles north of Osgiliath. Gondor maintained a steady garrison here,\n    as it was of paramount importance to Gondor during the long war with\n    Mordor, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river and\n    entering into Anórien.\n\n\n\n-   Calembel, a city in Lamedon.\n-   Dol Amroth, a city in Belfalas ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n-   Ethring, a ford and a large township built on either side of the\n    river Ringló.\n-   Henneth Annûn, a hidden refuge of Gondorian rangers in the northern\n    part of Ithilien along the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow.\n-   Linhir, a port city in Lebennin.\n-   Minas Tirith (originally Minas Anor), City of the Kings, the capital\n    (Third Age) and largest city of Gondor.\n-   Osgiliath, a city and former capital of Gondor on the river Anduin,\n    largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Age. During\n    the War of the Ring, Gondor kept a garrison on the west bank to\n    prevent the Enemy from crossing the river and assaulting Minas\n    Tirith. Osigiliath was the key to besiege Minas Tirith because of\n    its location and access to the river. Although the massive\n    Morgul-host led by the Witch-King to beseige Minas Tirith\n    overwhelmed the garrison, and drove the Gondorians out thus gaining\n    the passage of Anduin- the true beginning of the Siege of Gondor\n    that would conclude at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King\n    Elessar had it rebuilt after Sauron's downfall.\n-   Pelargir, the great southern harbour, which was captured by the\n    Corsairs during the War of the Ring. The people of Pelargir helped\n    in the Batttle of Pell\n-   Tarnost, a hill-town in Belfalas.\n\nAdditionally, Gondor had held the following locations at certain points\nin its history:\n\n-   Angrenost (Isengard), one of the three Fortresses of Gondor and held\n    within it one of the realm's Palantiri. Its location in Nan\n    Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains), was at the\n    northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the\n    Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together\n    with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of\n    Rohan. After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward\n    of Gondor and became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and\n    the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although\n    the rest of Gondor almost forgot about it. The small guard\n    intermarried much with the Dunlendings , until the place became a\n    Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained\n    closed, as the Steward of Gondor still held the keys. Isengard soon\n    came all but deserted.\n-   Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow)..\n-   Erech, a town of Gondor that was abandoned by the end of the Third\n    Age. To the north lay the Paths of the Dead.\n-   Minas Ithil, a city founded by Isildur that was originally the\n    sister city of Minas Anor. Located in an upland valley at the feet\n    of the Mountains of Shadow, it was built as a fortress city to\n    defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. It was later conquered by\n    the Nazgûl and renamed Minas Morgul.\n-   Tharbad, a city on both sides of the river Greyflood, (at one time\n    held by Gondor in the south and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as\n    Gondor's borders recessed through Enedwaith to the Isen, and later\n    ruined.\n-   Tower of Cirith Ungol, a Tower Fortress in western Mordor built by\n    Gondor to guard the pass of Cirith Ungol from any evil creature\n    trying to enter -or leave- Mordor. The Great Plague wiped out the\n    garrison located here, so it was easily captured when Sauron's\n    minions re-entered Mordor.\n-   Towers of the Teeth, two towers situated on either side of the Black\n    Gate. The two towers, called Carchost and Narchost, that stand on\n    either side of Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, which lies between\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow), and the Ash\n    Mountains. Originally built by Men of Gondor following the downfall\n    of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were\n    eventually taken over by the servants of the Dark Lord. They were\n    then repaired and fortified and were incorporated into the defenses\n    of the pass and gate.\n-   Umbar, the far southern harbour which was lost and reclaimed several\n    times, in the end being the home of Black Numenoreans, the Corsairs\n    of Umbar.\n",

    "text": "“MIDDLE-EARTH”, or ENDOR in Quenya (_ENNOR_ in Sindarin) - and in _The\nBook of Lost Tales_ THE GREAT LANDS - are the names used for the\nhabitable parts of Arda after the final ruin of Beleriand, east across\nthe Belegaer from Aman.\n\nThis continent is north of the Hither Lands shown in the Ambarkanta, and\nwest of the East Sea; and throughout the First and Second Ages it went\nthrough many colossal geographical changes, caused by Iluvatar.\n\n\nName\n\nThe term “Middle-earth” was not invented by Tolkien. Rather, it comes\nfrom Middle English _middel-erde_, itself a folk-etymology for the Old\nEnglish word _middangeard_ (_geard_ not meaning _Earth_, but rather\n_enclosure_ or _place_, thus _yard_, with the Old Norse word _miðgarðr_\nbeing a cognate). It is Germanic for what the Greeks called the\nοικουμένη (_oikoumenē_) or “the abiding place of men”, the physical\nworld as opposed to the unseen worlds (_The Letters of J. R. R.\nTolkien_, 151). The word _Mediterranean_ comes from two Latin stems,\n''medi- '', amidst, and _terra_, (earth/land), meaning “the sea placed\nat the middle of the Earth / amidst the lands”.\n\n_Middangeard_ occurs six times in Beowulf, which Tolkien translated and\non which he was arguably the world's foremost authority. (See also J. R.\nR. Tolkien for discussion of his inspirations and sources). See Midgard\nand Norse mythology for the older use. Tolkien made middle earth based\non the world today (Geography).\n\nTolkien was also inspired by this fragment:[Map of Middle-earth from the\nfilms]\n\n    _Eala earendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended._\n    _Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / above the middle-earth sent\n    unto men._\n\nin the “Crist” poem by Cynewulf. The name _earendel_ (which may mean the\n'morning-star' but in some contexts was a name for Christ) was the\ninspiration for Tolkien's mariner Eärendil.[Map of\nMiddle-earth]“Middle-earth” was consciously used by Tolkien to place\n_The Hobbit_, _The Lord of the Rings_, _The Silmarillion_, and related\nwritings.\n\n[Map of the Western part of Middle-earth at the end of the Third\nAge]Tolkien first used the term “Middle-earth” in the early 1930's in\nplace of the earlier terms “Great Lands”, “Outer Lands”, and “Hither\nLands” to describe the same region in his stories. “Middle-earth” is\nspecifically intended to describe the lands east of the Great Sea\n(Belegaer), thus excluding Aman, but including Harad and other mortal\nlands not visited in Tolkien's stories. Many people apply the name to\nthe entirety of Tolkien's world or exclusively to the lands described in\n_The Hobbit_, _The Lord of the Rings_, and _The Silmarillion_.\n\nIn ancient Germanic and mythology, the universe was believed to consist\nof multiple interconnected physical worlds (in Nordic mythology 9, in\nWest Germanic and English mythology, 8). The world of Men, the\nMiddle-earth, lay in the centre of this universe. The lands of Elves,\ngods, and Giants lay across an encircling sea. The land of the Dead lay\nbeneath the Middle-earth. A rainbow bridge, Bifrost Bridge, extended\nfrom Middle-earth to Asgard across the sea. An outer sea encircled the\nseven other worlds (Vanaheim, Asgard, Alfheim, SvartAlfheim,\nMuspellheim, Nidavellir, and Jotunheim). In this conception, a “world”\nwas more equivalent to a racial homeland than a physically separate\nworld.\n\n\nThe world\n\n[A speculative map of Arda before the end of the First Age, courtesy of\nthe Encyclopedia of Arda.]\n\nTolkien stated that the geography of Middle-earth was intended to align\nwith that of our real Earth in several particulars. (Letters #294)\nExpanding upon this idea some suggest that if the map of Middle-earth is\nprojected on our real Earth, and some of the most obvious\nclimatological, botanical, and zoological similarities are aligned, the\nHobbits' Shire might lie in the temperate climate of England, Gondor\nmight lie in the Mediterranean Italy and Greece, Mordor in Sicily, South\nGondor and Near Harad in the deserts of Northern Africa, Rhovanion in\nthe forests of Germany and the steppes of Western and Southern Russia,\nand the Ice Bay of Forochel in the fjords of Norway. Far Harad may have\ncorresponded with Southern Africa, and Rhûn corresponded with the whole\nof Asia. _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ are presented as\nTolkien's retelling of events depicted in the Red Book of Westmarch,\nwhich was written by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and other Hobbits,\nand corrected and annotated by one or more Gondorian scholars. Years\nafter publication, Tolkien 'postulated' in a letter that the action of\nthe books takes place roughly 6,000 years ago, though he was not\ncertain.\n\nTolkien wrote extensively about the linguistics, mythology and history\nof the world, which provide back-story for these stories. Many of these\nwritings were edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher.\n\nNotable among them is _The Silmarillion_, which provides a creation\nstory and description of the cosmology which includes Middle-earth. _The\nSilmarillion_ is the primary source of information about Valinor,\nNúmenor, and other lands. Also notable are _Unfinished Tales_ and the\nmultiple volumes of _The History of Middle-earth_, which includes many\nincomplete stories and essays as well as numerous drafts of Tolkien's\nMiddle-earth mythology, from the earliest forms down through the last\nwritings of his life.\n\n\nCosmology\n\nThe supreme deity is called Eru Ilúvatar. In the beginning, Ilúvatar\ncreated spirits named the Ainur and he taught them to make music. After\nthe Ainur had become proficient in their skills, Ilúvatar commanded them\nto make a great music based on a theme of his own design. The most\npowerful Ainu, Melkor (later called Morgoth or “Dark Enemy” by the\nelves), Tolkien's equivalent of Satan, disrupted the theme, and in\nresponse Ilúvatar introduced new themes that enhanced the music beyond\nthe comprehension of the Ainur. The movements of their song laid the\nseeds of much of the history of the as yet unmade universe and the\npeople who were to dwell therein.\n\nThen Ilúvatar stopped the music and he revealed its meaning to the Ainur\nthrough a Vision. Moved by the Vision, many of the Ainur felt a\ncompelling urge to experience its events directly. Ilúvatar therefore\ncreated Eä, the universe itself, and some of the Ainur went down into\nthe universe to share in its experience. But upon arriving in Eä, the\nAinur found it was shapeless because they had entered at the beginning\nof Time. The Ainur undertook great labours in these unnamed “ages of the\nstars”, in which they shaped the universe and filled it with many things\nfar beyond the reach of Men. In time, however, the Ainur formed Arda,\nthe abiding place of the Children of Ilúvatar, Elves and Men. The\nfifteen most powerful Ainur are called the Valar, of whom Melkor was the\nmost powerful, but Manwë was the leader. The Valar settled in Arda to\nwatch over it and help prepare it for the awakening of the Children.\n\nArda began as a single flat world, which the Valar gave light to through\ntwo immense lamps. Melkor destroyed the lamps and brought darkness to\nthe world. The Valar retreated to the extreme western regions of Arda,\nwhere they created the Two Trees to give light to their new homeland.\nAfter many ages, the Valar imprisoned Melkor to punish and rehabilitate\nhim, and to protect the awakening Children. But when Melkor was released\nhe poisoned the Two Trees. The Valar took the last two living fruit of\nthe Two Trees and used them to create the Moon and Sun, which remained a\npart of Arda but were separate from Ambar (the world).\n\nBefore the end of the Second Age, when the Men of Númenor rebelled\nagainst the Valar, Ilúvatar destroyed Númenor, separated Valinor from\nthe rest of Arda, and formed new lands, making the world round. Only\nEndor remained of the original world, and Endor had now become Eurasia.\n\n\nGeography\n\n[A political representation of the lands of Middle-earth] J.R.R. Tolkien\nnever finalized the geography for the entire world associated with _The\nHobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_. In _The Shaping of Middle-earth_,\nvolume IV of _The History of Middle-earth_, Christopher Tolkien\npublished several remarkable maps, of both the original flat earth and\nround world, which his father had created in the latter part of the\n1930s. Karen Wynn Fonstad drew from these maps to develop detailed, but\nnon-canonical, “whole world maps” reflecting a world consistent with the\nhistorical ages depicted in _The Silmarillion_, _The Hobbit_, and _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nMaps prepared by Christopher Tolkien and/or J.R.R. Tolkien for the world\nencompassing _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ were published as\nfoldouts or illustrations in _The Hobbit_, _The Lord of the Rings_, and\n_The Silmarillion_. Early conceptions of the maps provided in _The\nSilmarillion_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ were included in several\nvolumes, including “The First Silmarillion Map” in _The Shaping of\nMiddle-earth_, “The First Map of the Lord of the Rings” in _The Treason\nof Isengard_, “The Second Map (West)” and “The Second Map (East)” in the\n_War of the Ring_, and “The Second Map of Middle-earth west of the Blue\nMountains” (also known as “The Second Silmarillion Map”) in _The War of\nthe Jewels_.\n\n_Endor_, the Quenya term for Middle-earth, was originally conceived of\nas conforming to a largely symmetrical scheme which was marred by\nMelkor. The symmetry was defined by two large sub-continents, one in the\nnorth and one in the south, with each of them boasting two long chains\nof mountains in the eastward and westward regions. The mountain chains\nwere given names based on colours (White Mountains, Blue Mountains, Grey\nMountains, and Red Mountains).\n\nMiddle Earth map - FOTR.png\n\nThe various conflicts with Melkor resulted in the shapes of the lands\nbeing distorted. Originally, there was a single inland body of water, in\nthe midst of which was set the island of Almaren where the Valar lived.\nWhen Melkor destroyed the lamps of the Valar which gave light to the\nworld, two vast seas were created, but Almaren and its lake were\ndestroyed. The northern sea became the Sea of Helcar (Helkar). The lands\nwest of the Blue Mountains became Beleriand (meaning, “the land of\nBalar”). Melkor raised the Misty Mountains to impede the progress of the\nVala Orome as he hunted Melkor's beasts during the period of darkness\nprior to the awakening of the Elves.\n\nAdditional changes have occurred when Valar have assaulted Utumno. The\nNorth-west of the Middle-earth, where Melkor met the Valar host, was\n“much broken”. The sea between the Middle-earth and Aman widened, with\nmany bays created, including one which was the confluence of Sirion. The\nhighland of Dorthonion and the mountains about Hithlum were also a\nresult of the battles. Since the changes mentioned include both the\nbeginning and the ending points of Sirion, it is possible the river\nitself was created at the same time.\n\nThe violent struggles during the War of Wrath between the Host of the\nValar and the armies of Melkor at the end of the First Age brought about\nthe destruction of Beleriand. It is also possible that during this time\nthe inland sea of Helcar was drained.\n\nThe world, not including associated celestial bodies, was identified by\nTolkien as “Ambar” in several texts, but also identified as “Imbar”, the\nHabitation, in later post-_Lord of the Rings_ texts. From the time of\nthe destruction of the two lamps until the time of the Downfall of\nNúmenor, Ambar was supposed to be a “flat world”, in that its habitable\nland-masses were all arranged on one side of the world. His sketches\nshow a disk-like face for the world which looked up to the stars. A\nwestern continent, Aman, was the home of the Valar (and the Eldar). The\nmiddle lands, Endor, were called “Middle-earth” and the site of most of\nTolkien's stories. The eastern continent was not inhabited.\n\nWhen Melkor poisoned the Two Trees of the Valar and fled from Aman back\nto Endor, the Valar created the Sun and the Moon, which were separate\nbodies (from Ambar) but still parts of Arda (the Realm of the Children\nof Ilúvatar). A few years after publishing _The Lord of the Rings_, in a\nnote associated with the unique narrative story “Athrabeth Finrod ah\nAndreth” (which is said to occur in Beleriand during the War of the\nJewels), Tolkien equated Arda with the Solar System; because Arda by\nthis point consisted of more than one heavenly body.\n\nAccording to the accounts in both _The Silmarillion_ and _The Lord of\nthe Rings_, when Ar-Pharazôn invaded Aman to seize immortality from the\nValar, they laid down their guardianship of the world and Ilúvatar\nintervened, destroying Númenor, removing Aman “from the circles of the\nworld”, and reshaping Ambar into the round world of today. _Akallabêth_\nsays that the Numenoreans who survived the Downfall sailed as far west\nas they could in search of their ancient home, but their travels only\nbrought them around the world back to their starting points. Hence,\nbefore the end of the Second Age, the transition from “flat earth” to\n“round earth” had been completed.\n\nThe Endor continent became approximately equivalent to the Eurasian\nland-mass, but Tolkien's geography does not provide any exact\ncorrelations between the narrative of _The Lord of the Rings_ and Europe\nor near-by lands. It is therefore assumed that the reader understands\nthe world underwent a subsequent undocumented transformation (which some\npeople speculate Tolkien would have equated with the Biblical deluge)\nsometime after the end of the Third Age, or possibly at the fall of\nSauron itself at the end of the Third Age. Another explanation is that\nmany places shifted location, the Misty Mountains moving North to\nScandinavia, the White Mountains rotating to become the Alps and the\nmountains of the west Balkans, Near Harad moving south and west to\nbecome the Sahara, Eriador flooding to become northern France and the\nBritish Isles, and so on. This would not be the first time that this had\nhappened, as it seems that a consequence from the Siege of Utumno was\nthat Endor rotated eastward, its axis the north pole.\n\n\nPeople\n\n    _see also: List of Middle-earth people_\n\nMiddle-earth was home to several distinct intelligent species. First are\nthe Ainur, angelic beings created by Ilúvatar. The Ainur sing for\nIlúvatar, who creates Eä to give existence to their music in the\ncosmological myth called the _Ainulindalë_, or “Music of the Ainur”.\nSome of the Ainur then enter Eä, and the greatest of these are called\nthe Valar. Melkor (later called _Morgoth_), the chief personification of\nevil in Eä, is initially one of the Valar.\n\nThe other Ainur who enter Eä are called the Maiar. In the First Age the\nmost active Maia is Melian, wife of the Elven King Thingol; in the Third\nAge, during the War of the Ring, five of the Maiar have been embodied\nand sent to Endor to help the free people to overthrow Sauron. Those are\nthe Istari (or _Wise Ones_) (called Wizards by Men), including Gandalf,\nSaruman, Radagast, Alatar and Pallando. There were also evil Maiar,\ncalled Umaiar, including the Balrogs and the second Dark Lord, Sauron.\n\nLater come the Children of Ilúvatar: Elves and Men (men awoke in the\nfirst year of the sun), intelligent beings created by Ilúvatar alone.\n_The Silmarillion_ tells how Elves and Men awaken and spread through the\nworld. The Dwarves are said to have been made by the Vala Aulë, who\noffered to destroy them when Ilúvatar confronted him. Ilúvatar forgives\nAulë's transgression and adopts the Dwarves. Three tribes of Men who\nally themselves with the Elves of Beleriand in the First Age are called\nthe Edain.\n\nAs a reward for their loyalty and suffering in the Wars of Beleriand,\nthe descendants of the Edain are given the island of Númenor to be their\nhome. But as described in the section on Middle-earth's history, Númenor\nis eventually destroyed and a remnant of the Numenoreans establish\nrealms in the northern lands of Endor. Those who remained faithful to\nthe Valar found the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. They are then known as\nthe Dunedain, whereas other Númenórean survivors, still devoted to evil\nbut living far to the south, become known as the Black Numenoreans.\n\nTolkien identified Hobbits as an offshoot of the race of Men. Although\ntheir origins and ancient history are not known, Tolkien implied that\nthey settled in the Vales of Anduin early in the Third Age, but after a\nthousand years the Hobbits began migrating west over the Misty Mountains\ninto Eriador. Eventually, many Hobbits settled in the Shire.\n\nAfter they are granted true life by Ilúvatar, the Dwarves' creator Aulë\nlays them to sleep in hidden mountain locations. Ilúvatar awakens the\nDwarves only after the Elves have awakened. The Dwarves spread\nthroughout northern Endor and eventually found seven kingdoms. Two of\nthese kingdoms, Nogrod and Belegost, befriend the Elves of Beleriand\nagainst Morgoth in the First Age. The greatest Dwarf kingdom is\nKhazad-dûm, later known as Moria.\n\nThe Ents, “shepherds of the trees”, were created by Ilúvatar at the Vala\nYavanna's request to protect trees from the deprivations of Elves,\nDwarves, and Men.\n\nOrcs and Trolls were evil creatures bred by Morgoth. They were not\noriginal creations but rather “mockeries” of Ents and the Children of\nIlúvatar, since only Ilúvatar has the ability to give being to things.\nTheir origins are not detailed (Tolkien considered many possibilities\nand frequently changed his mind). It seems most likely that the Orcs\nwere bred largely from corrupted Elves or Men, or both. Late in the\nThird Age, the Uruks or Uruk-hai appear: a race of Orcs of great size\nand strength. Saruman bred Orcs and Men together to produce “Men-orcs”\nand “Orc-men”; at times, some of these are called “half-orcs” or\n“goblin-men”.\n\nSeemingly sapient animals also appear, such as the Eagles, Huan the\nGreat Hound from Valinor, and the Wargs. The Eagles are created by\nIlúvatar along with the Ents, but in general these animals' origins and\nnature are unclear. Some of them might be Maiar in animal form, or\nperhaps even the offspring of Maiar and normal animals.\n\nIt is unknown to what people of Middle-earth Tom Bombadil belonged. As\nto his nature, Tolkien himself said that some things should remain\nmysterious in any mythology, hidden even to its inventor.\n\n\nLanguages\n\nTolkien devised two main Elven languages which would later become known\nto us as Quenya, spoken by the Vanyar, Noldor, and some Teleri, and\nSindarin, spoken by the Elves who stayed in Beleriand (see below). These\nlanguages were related, and a Common Eldarin form ancestral to them both\nis postulated.\n\nOther languages of the world include\n\n-   Adûnaic – spoken by the Numenoreans\n-   Black Speech – devised by Sauron for his slaves to speak\n-   Khuzdûl – spoken by the Dwarves\n-   Rohirric – spoken by the Rohirrim – represented in the Lord of the\n    Rings by Old English\n-   Westron – the 'Common Speech' – represented by English\n-   Valarin – the language of the Ainur\n\n\nHistory of Middle-earth\n\nThe history of Middle-earth is divided into three time periods, known as\nthe Years of the Lamps, Years of the Trees and Years of the Sun; the\nlatter is typically sub-divided further into four Ages, of which three\nare relevant to the printed works of the legendarium.\n\nThe Years of the Lamps began shortly after the Valar finished their\nlabours in shaping Arda. The Valar created two lamps to illuminate the\nworld, and the Vala Aulë forged great towers, one in the furthest north,\nHelcar with the lamp Illuin, and another in the deepest south, Ringol\nwith the lamp Ormal. The Valar lived in the middle, at the island of\nAlmaren. Melkor's destruction of the two Lamps marked the end of the\nYears of the Lamps.\n\n[A speculative map of Aman during the Second Age.]\n\nThen Yavanna made the Two Trees named Telperion and Laurelin in the land\nof Aman. The Trees illuminated Aman, leaving the rest of Arda in\ndarkness, illuminated only by the stars. At the start of the First Age\nthe Elves awoke beside Lake Cuiviénen in the east of Endor, and were\nsoon approached by the Valar. Many of the elves were persuaded to\nundertake the Great Journey westwards towards Aman, but not all of them\ncompleted the journey (see Sundering of the Elves). The Valar had\nimprisoned Melkor but he appeared to repent and was released on parole.\nHe sowed great discord among the Elves and stirred up rivalry between\nthe Elven princes Fëanor and Fingolfin. He then slew their father, king\nFinwë and stole the Silmarils, three gems crafted by Fëanor that\ncontained light of the Two Trees, from his vault, and destroyed the\nTrees themselves.\n\nFëanor persuaded most of his people, the Noldor, to leave Aman in\npursuit of Melkor to Beleriand, cursing him with the name _Morgoth_.\nFëanor led the first of two groups of Noldor. The larger group was led\nby Fingolfin. The Noldor stopped at the Teleri's port-city, Alqualondë,\nbut the Teleri refused to give them ships to get to Middle-earth. The\nfirst Kinslaying thus ensued; Fëanor and many of his followers attacked\nthe Teleri and stole their ships. Fëanor's host sailed on the stolen\nships, leaving Fingolfin's behind to cross over to Middle-earth through\nthe deadly Helcaraxë (or Grinding Ice) in the far north. Subsequently\nFëanor was slain, but most of his sons survived and founded realms, as\ndid Fingolfin and his heirs.\n\nThe Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun and it rose over\nthe world, Imbar. After several great battles, a Long Peace ensued for\nfour hundred years, during which time the first Men entered Beleriand by\ncrossing over the Blue Mountains. When Morgoth broke the siege of\nAngband, one by one the Elven kingdoms fell, even the hidden city of\nGondolin. The only measurable success achieved by Elves and Men came\nwhen Beren of the Edain and Luthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian,\nretrieved a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth. Afterward, Beren and\nLuthien died, and were restored to life by the Valar with the\nunderstanding that Luthien was to become mortal and Beren should never\nbe seen by Men again.\n\nThingol quarrelled with the Dwarves of Nogrod and they slew him,\nstealing the Silmaril. With the help of Ents, Beren waylaid the Dwarves\nand recovered the Silmaril, which he gave to Luthien. Soon afterwards,\nboth Beren and Luthien died again. The Silmaril was given to their son\nDior Half-Elven, who had restored the Kingdom of Doriath. The sons of\nFëanor demanded that Dior surrender the Silmaril to them, and he\nrefused. The Fëanorians destroyed Doriath and killed Dior in the second\nKinslaying, but Dior's young daughter Elwing escaped with the jewel.\nThree sons of Fëanor – Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir – died trying to\nretake the jewel.\n\nBy the end of the age, all that remained of the free Elves and Men in\nBeleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion. Among them\nwas Eärendil, who married Elwing. But the Fëanorians again demanded the\nSilmaril be returned to them, and after their demand was rejected they\nresolved to take the jewel by force, leading to the third Kinslaying.\nEärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril across the Great Sea, to beg the\nValar for pardon and aid. The Valar responded. Melkor was captured, most\nof his works were destroyed, and he was banished beyond the confines of\nthe world into the Door of Night.\n\nThe Silmarils were recovered at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was\nbroken and began to sink under the sea. Feanor's last remaining sons,\nMaedhros and Maglor, were ordered to return to Valinor. They proceeded\nto steal the Silmarils from the victorious Valar. But, as with Melkor,\nthe Silmarils burned their hands and they then realized they were not\nmeant to possess them and that the oath was null. Each of the brothers\nmet his fate: Maedhros threw himself with the Silmaril into a chasm of\nfire, and Maglor threw his Silmaril into the sea. Thus the three\nSilmarils ended in the sky with Eärendil, in the earth, and in the sea\nrespectively.\n\nThus began the Second Age. The Edain were given the island of Númenor\ntoward the west of the Great Sea as their home, while many elves were\nwelcomed into the West. The Numenoreans became great seafarers, but also\nbecame increasingly jealous of the elves for their immortality. But\nafter a few centuries, Sauron, Morgoth's chief servant, began to\norganize evil creatures in the eastern lands. He persuaded Elven smiths\nin Eregion to create Rings of Power, and secretly forged the One Ring to\ncontrol the other rings. But the elves became aware of Sauron's plan as\nsoon as he put the One Ring on his hand, and they removed their own\nRings before he could master their wills.\n\n[A map of Númenor during the Second Age, courtesy of the Encyclopedia of\nArda.]\n\nThe last Númenórean king Ar-Pharazôn, by the strength of his army,\nhumbled even Sauron and brought him to Númenor as a hostage. But with\nthe help of the One Ring, Sauron deceived Ar-Pharazôn and convinced the\nking to invade Aman, promising immortality for all those who set foot on\nthe Undying Lands. Amandil, chief of those still faithful to the Valar,\ntried to sail west to seek their aid. His son Elendil and grandsons\nIsildur and Anárion prepared to flee east to Middle-earth. When the\nKing's forces landed on Aman, the Valar called for Ilúvatar to\nintervene. The world was changed, and Aman was removed from Imbar. From\nthat time onward, Men could no longer find Aman, but Elves seeking\npassage in specially hallowed ships received the grace of using the\nStraight Road, which led from Middle-earth's seas to the seas of Aman.\nNúmenor was utterly destroyed, and with it the fair body of Sauron, but\nhis spirit endured and fled back to Middle-earth. Elendil and his sons\nescaped to Endor and founded the realms of Gondor and Arnor. Sauron soon\nrose again, but the elves allied with the men to form the Last Alliance\nand defeated him. His One Ring was taken from him by Isildur, but not\ndestroyed.\n\n[Middle-earth during the Third Age] The Third Age saw the rise in power\nof the realms of Arnor and Gondor, and their decline. By the time of\n_The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron had recovered much of his former\nstrength, and was seeking the One Ring. He discovered that it was in the\npossession of a Hobbit and sent out the nine Ringwraiths to retrieve it.\nThe Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, travelled to Rivendell, where it was\ndecided that the Ring had to be destroyed in the only way possible:\ncasting it into the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo set out on the quest with\neight companions—the Fellowship of the Ring. At the last moment he\nfailed, but with the intervention of the creature Gollum—who was saved\nby the pity of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins—the Ring was nevertheless\ndestroyed. Frodo with his companion Sam Gamgee were hailed as heroes.\nSauron was destroyed forever and his spirit dissipated.\n\nThe end of the Third Age marked the end of the dominion of the elves and\nthe beginning of the dominion of men. As the Fourth Age began, many of\nthe elves who had lingered in Middle-earth left for Valinor, never to\nreturn; those who remained behind would “fade” and diminish. The dwarves\neventually dwindled away as well. The dwarves eventually returned in\nlarge numbers and resettled Moria. Peace was restored between Gondor and\nthe lands to the south and east. Eventually, the tales of the earlier\nAges became legends, the truth behind them forgotten.",

    "text": "ROHAN was a great kingdom of Men, located in the land once known as\nCALENARDHON, situated in the great vale between the Misty Mountains to\nthe north and the White Mountains to the south. The land of Rohan\nextended from the fords of the river Isen in the west, up to the shores\nof the river Anduin in the east. The forest of Fangorn lay within the\nborders of Rohan, and the Elven city of Lorien lay to the north of the\nriver Limlight.\n\nThe land of Rohan was originally part of Gondor, but gained independence\nfrom it. The land was first known as “Rohan” to the Men of Gondor, and\nits people the Rohirrim, meaning 'the Horse-lords', but the people of\nRohan called themselves the Eorlingas, sons of Eorl the Young, first\nKing of Rohan, as the land of Calenardhon was given in gift to Eorl and\nhis people by Cirion, Steward of Gondor, in thanks for their service to\nGondor in battle against the Balchoth. Eorl, the first king, swore an\noath of friendship, at need or at call, to the Lords of Gondor, and thus\nthe Rohirrim became the greatest allies of the Men of Gondor throughout\nthe Third Age and beyond. They were known for their cavalry and horse\ntraining, which came into use countless times in battles such as the\nBattle of the Hornburg and on the Pelennor Fields.\n\n[]\n\n\nHistory\n\nDescent from the Northmen\n\nIn the 1200s of the Third Age, the Kings of Gondor made alliances with\nthe Northmen of Rhovanion, a people thought to be distantly descended\nfrom the Edain, those peoples of Men who crossed into Beleriand in the\nFirst Age and later settled in Númenor. The men who would become the\nRohirrim were in fact more closely akin to the Beornings and the Men of\nDale, and are accounted as Middle Men, who, while not directly descended\nfrom the Men of Númenor, never served the will of Sauron. In “The Two\nTowers”, Aragorn describes the Rohirrim thusly:\n\nIn the early part of the Third Age, such men occupied a territory known\nas Rhovanion, the lands east of Mirkwood, Greenwood the Great, west of\nthe inland Sea of Rhûn, and south of the Celduin (the River Running).\nWhile never united under one singular king, the Men of Rhovanion\nnonetheless were allies of Gondor, and many of the great Princes of\nRhovanion and their kin served in the armies of Gondor. In this way was\nthe ruling House of Gondor mingled with the Northmen during the reign of\nKing Eldacar, and the Northmen intermarried with the Dunedain of the\nSouth and were eventually reckoned Men of Gondor. Through nearly\nconstant conflict with the Men of Rhûn (Balchoth, Wainriders, and the\nlike), the population of Rhovanion dwindled.\n\nIn the late 1000s of the Third Age, one such population of Northmen,\ndwelling in the eaves of Mirkwood, became a separate people under the\nlordship of Marhari, a descendant of Vidugavia, one of the most powerful\nprinces of Rhovanion. Fighting alongside King Narmacil II of Gondor, his\npeople were defeated by the Wainriders, invaders from the east, and the\nlast remnants of the Northmen were scattered. Marhwini, son of Marhari,\ntook up the lordship of his father and, retreating north with a remnant\nof his people, became the first chieftain of the people who would become\nthe Rohirrim. Settling first in the vales of Anduin between the Carrock\nand Gladden Fields, his people began to slowly recover their strength,\nand became known as the Éothéod, the horse peoples. Marhwini, and later\nhis son Forthwini, continued their alliance with Gondor, fighting the\nWainriders and other eastern invaders alongside Kings Calimehtar and\nOndoher. Although the Eotheod won pyrrhic victories over their foes\nwhile allied to Gondor, and reconquered the lands once held by Lords of\nRhovanion, their settlements remained near the Anduin.\n\nThe Éothéod\n\nIn the 1970s of the Third Age, after the downfall of the Witch-king and\nhis Kingdom of Angmar, their need for larger lands and the growing\nmenace of Dol Guldur, forced Frumagar (called Frungor in some texts),\nchieftain of the Éothéod, to lead his people north along the eastern\nbanks of Anduin. They settled near the sources of Anduin, south of the\nGrey Mountains. Their chief city became Framsburg, which lay in a vale\nbetween the rivers Limlight and Greylin. During their time in the far\nnorth, the Éothéod and their horses multiplied, and they drove the last\nremnants of the Hillmen of Angmar out of their lands. Fram, son of\nFrumagar, slew the dragon Scatha, last of the Great Worms of the Grey\nMountains, save Smaug of the Lonely Mountain; thus he won great wealth\nfrom the horde of Scatha, as well as renown for the deed. He also earned\nthe hatred of the Dwarves of that region, for they claimed the treasure\nof Scatha. Fram infuriated the Dwarves by sending them the teeth of\nScatha, strung as a necklace, and denying them the rest of the horde.\nSome say that for this reason the Dwarves slew Fram, for whom the city\nof Framsburg was named; for that reason there was no great love between\nthe Rohirrim and Dwarves.\n\nFive hundred years of relative prosperity followed for the Éothéod in\nthe north, and they multiplied into a numerous people, with many farms\nand horses. In 2501, Léod, chieftain of the Éothéod, captured a white\nfoal in the wilds; this foal would grow to great stature, but remain\nwild and was not tamed by any man. When Léod decided to mount the horse,\nit bore him away from his stables and eventually threw him, whereupon\nLeod's head struck a rock, killing him. Eorl, son of Léod, despite being\njust 16 years of age, took up the lordship of the Éothéod, and made it a\nmission to find the horse that had killed his father. Finally, he\ntracked down and confronted the stallion, but rather than slay him, Eorl\ncommanded that the horse give up his freedom as a weregild for the\nkilling of Léod. This horse understood the speech of men, and submitted\nto Eorl, and was named anew Felarof.\n\nThe Gift of Calenardhon and the Oath of Eorl\n\nIn the year TA 2509, Eorl received summons from Cirion, Steward of\nGondor. The Steward pleaded for help from Gondor's old allies; as a\ncombined force of Easterlings had invaded the province of Calenardhon\nand was nigh upon invading the rest of the South Kingdom. Therefore,\nEorl surprised even the errand-rider of Gondor by agreeing to come to\nthe aid of Cirion. Though young, Eorl wisely perceived that if Gondor\nshould fall, all the lesser realms of men west of Anduin would\neventually fall under the dominion of Sauron. He gathered all men of the\nÉothéod that could possibly be spared, and, leaving his land at risk of\ninvasion itself, rode south to the aid of Gondor. Despite a prejudice\nagainst the Elves that would carry up until the time of the War of the\nRing, a protective mist seemed to come out of Lothlórien as the Éothéod\njourneyed south, rejuvenating horse and rider and shielding their\napproach from their enemies. Believing that there would be no time for\nthe Éothéod to help his armies, Cirion nonetheless met them in battle on\nthe field of Celebrant, though Gondor's legions were worsted. All hope\nseemed lost when an army of Orcs came upon the flank of the army of\nGondor, but at that moment Eorl and his cavalry thundered out of the\nnorth unlooked for and, smashing the rear of the orc battalions,\ncompletely reversed the fortunes of battle. Gondor's army was saved from\ndestruction, and the riders of the Éothéod continued to pursue their\nenemies in a great rout across the eastern plains.\n\nCirion committed the guardianship of Calenardhon to Eorl and his men for\nthree months, during which time the Steward took council to determine\nwhat reward he could present to the Éothéod for their heroic arrival on\nthe Field of Celebrant. At the end of the three months, he rode north to\nCalenardhon with his son Hallas and his counsellors, and led Eorl and\nsome of his guard to the hidden tomb of Elendil upon Amon Anwar (Hill of\nAwe), which was later renamed Halifirien (the Holy Mountain) in\nRohirric. Cirion realised that the Éothéod as a people needed more room\nto flourish, and that they would make for a strong ally to Gondor\nagainst the growing threat of Sauron and the continued harassment of the\nEasterlings. Therefore, upon Amon Anwar he told Eorl that in reward for\ntheir aid in battle, he would grant the land of Calenardhon to the\nÉothéod to dwell in. Eorl was so impressed and grateful for Cirion's\ngift that he swore to the Steward the 'Oath of Eorl', of everlasting\nfriendship to Gondor, and aid to the South Kingdom in war against the\nEast. Eorl thus became the first King of Rohan, and his army sent north\nfor their wives and kin. Coming into the land of Calenardhon the Éothéod\nwere named anew the Rohirrim in Gondor, and named their new realm the\nMark of the Riders, and themselves the Eorlingas.\n\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Rohan\n\n\n\nEorl was succeeded upon his death in battle by his son Brego. It was\nBrego who completed the great hall of Meduseld, which became the home of\nthe Kings of Rohan thereafter. Brego's first son Baldor made a vow to\ntread the Paths of the Dead at the celebration to commemorate the\ncompletion of Meduseld, but was lost in the caverns beneath Dwimorberg.\nBrego was grieved at the loss of his son and died soon after, leaving\nrule of Rohan to his younger son Aldor. Aldor was called 'the Old', for,\ncoming young to the throne, he ruled the Mark for 75 years.\n\nOf the Kings between Aldor and the 7th king Déor, little is said, but\nduring the time of Déor, the Dunlendings, lesser Men who once dwelt in\nthe mountains and vales but whom the Rohirrim drove west over Isen upon\nentering Calenardhon, began again to raid the western borders of the\nMark. In 2710, the Dunlendings captured the mostly-deserted fortress of\nIsengard, and held it in defiance of the Rohirrim.\n\nThe Dunlendings continued their harassment of Rohan through the time of\nHelm Hammerhand, 9th king of Rohan. Helm was a man of great stature and\nstrength, and a strong king who wished to again subdue the Dunlendings.\nOne particularly troublesome Dunlending was named Freca; though he\nclaimed descent from the fifth king Fréawine, Freca was mostly of\nDunlendish blood. Nonetheless, he held a good amount of land on the\nAdorn river, and had there made himself a stronghold where he largely\nignored the rule of Helm. On a time, Freca came to Helm's counsel at\nEdoras, and there suggested that the King allow his daughter to wed with\nWulf, son of Freca. Helm, seeing this as nothing but a ploy to bring\nFreca's heir close to the kingly House and thus increase the potential\nfor Rohan to fall into Dunlending hands, mocked Freca. Freca then\ninsulted the king, and eventually Helm smote him a blow with his fist,\nkilling him. Then Helm sent his men west to drive away Wulf and his\nfollowers, declaring them enemies of Rohan.\n\n\n\nBy ill chance, these events were followed by an attack upon Gondor by\nthe Corsairs. Seeing the opportunity to attack Rohan while its allies\nwere beset by other foes, Wulf led a strong force of the Dunlendings out\nof Isengard and defeated Helm's army, driving the king and many of his\npeople to the fortress of the Hornburg, which was later known as Helm's\nDeep. Wulf captured Meduseld, and Helm's son Haleth was slain in its\ndefense. Wulf sat upon the throne and called himself king and the Long\nWinter began, during which many of the people of Rohan perished from\nsickness and hunger and battle with the Dunlendings. Helm, besieged\ninside the Hornburg, became gaunt and grim, and eventually began to\nventure from the fort at night, stalking the camps of the Dunlendings\nand killing men with his bare hands. Before he would come forth in the\ndark, Helm would blow a blast upon his great horn, which struck fear\ninto his enemies, and they fled upon hearing it (this was the Horn of\nHelm's Deep in the Lord of the Rings). In this way, Helm won renown, and\nwas much feared for many generations after by the Dunlendings, but one\nnight he froze to death outside the walls of the Hornburg, and the royal\nhouse fell into shambles.\n\n\n\nWith the onset of spring, Helm's nephew Fréaláf Hildeson led a small\narmy down from Dunharrow, where another remnant of the Rohirrim had\nlasted out the winter. Coming upon Edoras unawares, they slew Wulf and\nreclaimed Meduseld. Helm's body was brought back from the Hornburg and\nburied in the last mound of the first line of the Kings of Rohan, and\nthe white Simbelmyne grew so thick upon his mound that it appeared\nsnow-capped. Fréaláf successfully drove out the remaining Dunlendings\nbefore the year was ended, finally receiving aid from Gondor, which had\ndefeated the Corsairs, and Fréaláf became King. To his crowning came\nSaruman the White, bearing gifts and praising the Rohirrim for their\ncourage. He took up his abode at Isengard in 2759, a gift from Beren,\nSteward of Gondor. Fréaláf was content to have such a strong ally in the\nwest against the Dunlendings as Saruman, as the Rohirrim had suffered\ngreat loss of men and horses during the hard winter. Eventually, though,\nas is explained elsewhere, Saruman became an enemy of Rohan and deigned\nto rule from Isengard as a lord of Men.\n\nFréaláf's son was Brýtta Léofa, a beloved king who stabilized Rohan once\nagain, and the people began to prosper. In his time, however, orcs\nfleeing the Misty Mountains after the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799\nbegan to take refuge in the foothills of the White Mountains. Brytta's\nson Walda reigned for just nine years before he was killed by a group of\nOrcs. Folca, son of Walda, was a great hunter, and took a vow upon\nbecoming king that he would not hunt beasts again until every orc had\nbeen driven out of Rohan. After destroying what was held to be the last\norc-hold in Rohan, he journeyed to the Firien wood, to kill the Great\nBoar that lived there. He slew the boar, but died of the wounds he\nreceived in the act of killing it. The reign of Folcwine, son of Folca,\nsaw a return to prosperity for Rohan, as he subdued the lands around the\nriver Isen, and drove out the Dunlendings. In his reign, the Rohirrim\nrecovered from their losses in the war against Wulf. He also came to the\naid of Gondor when a great army of the Haradrim came up against the\nSouth Kingdom. Persuaded not to go to battle himself, Folcwine sent\ninstead his twin sons, Folcred and Fastred. Although the combined armies\nof Rohan and Gondor won a great victory at the Battle of the Crossings\nof Poros on the banks of the River Poros in South Ithilien, the sons of\nKing Folcwine fell side by side in battle. Steward Túrin II of Gondor\ntherefore paid a rich weregild of gold to Folcwine for his sacrifice.\n\nFolcwine's third son, Fengel, is not remembered with honor. He did\nlittle to further strengthen Rohan, and was at odds with both his\nMarshalls and his kin. His only son, Thengel, therefore spent much time\nin Gondor, and won praise through his service to Steward Turgon. He\nmarried Morwen of Lossarnach, and began to raise a family in Gondor.\nEventually, when Fengel died, Thengel returned to Rohan to take up the\nkingship. While Thengel was wise and restored dignity to the House of\nEorl, he did create some discord by encouraging the use of the language\nof Gondor in Edoras. At the time of Thengel's return to Rohan, Saruman\nfirst began to openly trouble the Rohirrim, and he declared himself Lord\nof Isengard. Also during Thengel's reign, the captain Thorongil (later\nrevealed to be Aragorn II Elessar) first appeared in Rohan, and entered\nthe service of the king, and was renowned. Thengel's son was Théoden the\nRenowned.\n\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n\n\nThéoden Ednew had the makings of a great king for, in his youth, he\nproved valiant in battle, and he possessed both wisdom and a gentle\nheart away from war. Yet by 3014, Saruman had begun to invade the king's\nmind, using spells and his servant Gríma Wormtongue to bewitch Théoden.\nAs the king slipped into indifference, Saruman began to probe the\nborders of Rohan with his armies. He had taken into his service orcs and\nUruk-hai, and would eventually recruit the hillmen of Dunland to again\nassail their neighbors in Rohan. Théodred, son of Théoden, along with\nhis cousin Éomer (who was of the royal line by both parents; his father\nwas descended from Éofor, third son of Brego, and his mother was\nTheoden's sister), took charge of the Mark and its defenses against the\ngrowing threat of Isengard. Saruman, through Gríma, constantly\nforestalled Théodred and the other Marshalls of the Mark, and, by the\nbewitchment of Théoden, thwarted Rohan's attempts to muster any great\nforce of arms in opposition. He even blinded the king to Gandalf's\nwarnings that Rohan was in peril upon his return from Orthanc, and\nGandalf was forced to take Shadowfax and ride to Rivendell in hopes of\nmeeting up with Frodo.\n\nAs the Fellowship took the One Ring east from Rivendell, Saruman's\nforces increased their attack upon Rohan, in addition to his intensified\nhunt for the Ring. Aragorn and his companions chanced to meet up with\nÉomer and his eored upon the plains of Rohan near Fangorn, and there\nrevealed himself to be the heir of Isildur, and asked news and aid from\nÉomer. The Rohirrim were returning from battle with a legion of Uruk-hai\nthat had captured Merry and Pippin, and Éomer gave what tidings he could\nof his doings and the condition of Rohan to Aragorn. Lending the\ncompanions a pair of horses, Éomer then led his men to continue their\ntask of gathering the East-mark's herdfolk to safety. Upon his return to\nEdoras, Gríma had Éomer imprisoned for defying Saruman's orders spoken\nthrough Theoden.\n\nThéodred led what riders he could gather to the Fords of Isen in an\nattempt to halt Saruman's assault upon Rohan, and there he fought the\nadvance troops of the great army, which was sent to take Helm's Deep.\nThe dismounted riders formed a great shield-wall along the fords, but\nwere eventually beaten back with great loss. Saruman unleashed a legion\nof orc-men armed with axes upon the Rohirrim with the specific intent to\nkill Théodred, who was known to be present at the battle of the Fords.\nThe forces of Isengard were successful in this task, as well, mortally\nwounding the king's son. They would have likely taken Théodred as a\nprize were it not for the valor of Grimbold, who stood over the prince's\nbody and fought until reinforcements led by Elfhelm arrived. The\nRohirrim were forced to retreat towards Hornburg, and there recover what\nstrength was left in hope of defending that great fortress.\n\nWhile the battle at the Fords of Isen was being fought, Gandalf\njourneyed towards Edoras with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Upon his\narrival, the members of the Fellowship managed to enter Théoden's hall\nand there confront Grimá. Gandalf, in a display of his new power after\nreturning from death in Moria, broke Saruman's hold on the king's mind,\nand spoke to Théoden concerning the true happenings of the past weeks,\nwhen Saruman advanced upon his lands unbeknownst to the king. Théoden\nfreed Éomer at Gandalf's urging, and banished Grimá, who was revealed at\nlast to the king as an agent of Saruman. Summoning all men able to bear\narms, Théoden hastily set out for the Hornburg, where he thought to make\na stand against Saruman's army. Gandalf, meanwhile, left both his\ncompanions of the Fellowship and Théoden and rode urgently to meet up\nwith Treebeard, who led the Ents against Isengard and coordinated the\nattack of the Huorns upon Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep.\n\nThe Rohirrim under Théoden arrived at the Hornburg just before the main\nforce of Saruman's army, and through the night, a battle raged for\npossession of Helm's Deep, the fortress that no opposing army had ever\ntaken. Strengthened by what men had retreated from the Fords of Isen and\nled by Aragorn and Éomer, the Rohirrim managed to repel the hosts of\nIsengard for most of the night, but as dawn approached, Saruman's secret\nweapon, a blasting fire, was revealed, and great holes were torn in the\nwalls of the Hornburg. Desiring to make a final stand, Théoden rode down\nout of the Hornburg with the knights of his household, with Aragorn\nbeside him, and they hewed a path through Saruman's forces to the walls\nof the fortress. There, they beheld an amazing sight; a forest that had\nliterally appeared overnight - the Huorns. Adding to the dismay of\nSaruman's army at the sudden onset of the king and his men, as well as\nthe Huorns, Gandalf reappeared, having found Erkenbrand, Lord of\nWestfold, and a thousand more warriors who had survived the battle at\nthe Fords of Isen. With all three allies descending upon the orcs and\nDunlendings, Saruman's forces surrendered or were killed, and Rohan\ngained a hard-fought victory.\n\nGandalf then led Théoden, along with what remained of the Fellowship and\nalso Éomer, with picked Riders of the Mark, to Isengard, which now lay\nin ruins after the attack of the Ents. There, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli\nwere reunited with Merry and Pippin, and Gandalf introduced Théoden to\nTreebeard. The group also confronted Saruman, who refused to alter his\nways. Gandalf broke Saruman's staff and cast him from the White Council\nas well as the Order of the Istari. Gríma attempted to throw Saruman's\nPalantír at Gandalf, but missed, and in this way was a vital connection\nmade clear between Saruman and Sauron. Pippin later looked into the\nPalantír, which encouraged Sauron to send his Nazgûl over the river\nAnduin, and the assault he had long planned against the west began to\ntake shape. Théoden and his men rode back to Helm's Deep with the\nremnant of the Fellowship, while Gandalf set out for Minas Tirith with\nPippin. While on their way to the Hornburg, Théoden's party met up with\nthe Grey Company under Halbarad and the sons of Elrond, and eventually\nAragorn would set out with his kinsmen to pass the Paths of the Dead.\nThéoden and Éomer, along with their growing army, rode on to Harrowdale,\nwhere the great muster of Rohan was already underway. Once at Dunharrow,\nan errand-rider from Gondor came to the King, begging for help on behalf\nof Gondor and the Steward Denethor. Théoden fulfilled the Oath of Eorl,\ntelling the rider that he should bring six thousand warriors to defend\nthe Mundburg.\n\nOn the road to Minas Tirith, Théoden's army received help from\nGhân-buri-Ghân, chieftain of the Drúedain, and came to Rammas Echor at\ndawn of March 15 of the year 3019. That day he led the Rohirrim onto the\nPelennor Fields, and the host of Rohan at first overwhelmed the\norc-legions of Sauron. Théoden then led his knights against the cavalry\nof the Haradrim as well, personally slaying their chieftain, and hewing\nhis banner. Yet in that moment of great victory for the king, the Lord\nof the Nazgul descended upon Théoden and mortally wounded him. Éowyn,\nsister of Éomer, had ridden to war with the Rohirrim, unknown to any of\nthe men of the Mark, and revealed herself in single combat with the\nWitch-king. With the aid of Merry, Éowyn slew the Witch-king, and thus\nwon great renown among all the peoples of the west for her bravery.\nThéoden, as he lay dying, called Éomer, now his heir, King of the Mark,\nand bade him tell Éowyn farewell, not knowing that his niece had\ndefended him from the Witch-king. His knights bore Théoden's body out of\nthe battle, while Éomer led the Rohirrim in their continued assault upon\nthe Haradrim. The forces of Mordor greatly outnumbered the armies of\nGondor and Rohan, however, and defeat appeared nigh, when Aragorn,\nreturning from the Paths of the Dead, came up from the coast in the\ncaptured ships of the Corsairs, and, leading a great many warriors\ngathered from the southern fiefs of Gondor, helped to turn the tide of\nbattle.\n\nAfter the victory on the field of Pelennor, Éomer took counsel with the\nCaptains of the Host of the West, and it was decided that an attempt\nmust be made to draw Sauron's eye away from his own lands, and to allow\nthe Ringbearer time to complete his mission. Éomer led nearly three\nthousand of the Rohirrim to battle, leaving Elfhelm another three\nthousand to help defend Minas Tirith, as well as an eored that returned\nto Rohan's eastern borders to guard against a possible assault from the\nnorth. Upon reaching the land of Mordor, Éomer and his men helped to win\nFrodo time, and the Black Gates were thrown down, yet much more of that\nday is told elsewhere. The victorious army of the West returned to Minas\nTirith for the crowning of Aragorn as King Elessar Telcontar; Éowyn\nagreed to marry Faramir, son of Denethor, and later Aragorn renewed the\nGift of Cirion, and Éomer took again the Oath of Eorl. Weeks later,\nÉomer returned to Gondor with many of the Rohirrim, and they, along with\nAragorn and many fair folk, rode to Meduseld, where they laid Théoden to\nrest in a great mound outside Edoras.\n\nIn the years that followed the War of the Ring, Éomer Éadig ruled the\nRohirrim with dignity, and the kingdom prospered once again. In the\ncoming years, whenever King Elessar went with war to subdue the last\nremnants of his enemies, so too went his friend King Éomer;\n\n\nDescription\n\nImportant places and the borders of Rohan\n\nThe capital of Rohan is the hill fort of Edoras which lies on the slopes\nof the White Mountains. Another large city is ALDBURG, capital city of\nthe Eastfold and original city of Eorl the Young. Other cities may have\nexisted but are not named.\n\nA known camp is Dunharrow, even deeper in the White Mountains. One of\nthe most impressive places in Rohan is the Hornburg, a great fortress\nwhich is part of a chain of fortifications at Helm's Deep.\n\nThe borders of Rohan are: the river Isen (in the west, bordering\nSaruman’s Isengard); the river Adorn (a tributary of Isen, also in the\nwest, forming the border with the unfriendly Dunlendings); the White\nMountains (in the south); the Mering Stream (in the southeast, the\nborder between Rohan and Gondor); the Mouths of Entwash (in the east);\nand the Limlight (a tributary of the Anduin, the northern border).\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Rohan was roughly a third the size\nof Gondor, whose borders had slowly been shrinking for decades.\n\nClimate and countryside\n\nThe countryside of Rohan is described as a land of pastures and lush\ntall grassland. It looks a lot like the Central Asian steppe or North\nAmerican Great Plains, as does its climate. The lands of Rohan are\nfrequently described as appearing like “seas of grass”.\n\nRohirric\n\nRohirric is, like the languages of all Men, akin to Adûnaic, the\nlanguage of the Edain. The Rohirrim call their homeland the\n_Ridenna-mearc_, the _Riddermark_ or _Éo-marc_, the _Horse-mark_, also\nsimply the _Mark_ and call themselves the _Eorlingas_, the Sons of Eorl.\nIn the original Rohirric the name for their land is _Lôgrad_, with the\nelement “lô-”/“loh-” corresponding to Anglo-Saxon “éo”, horse.\n\nRohirric bears a similar relationship to the Common Speech of\nMiddle-earth as that of Old English to modern English, and so Tolkien\nrenders Rohirric names and phrases into Old English (Anglo-Saxon), just\nas the Common Speech is translated into English. Examples include words\nsuch as _Mearas_ (Old English for horses) and _éored_. Tolkien was a\nphilologist, with a special interest in Germanic languages. _See\nseparate article “Rohirric”._\n\nMany archaic Hobbit names bear similarities to Rohirric, since the\nancestors of the Shire hobbits lived on the upper reaches of the Anduin,\nclose to the ancestors of the Rohirrim, and there was apparently a good\ndeal of linguistic cross-fertilisation. The name _Hobbit_ itself is\nbelieved to be derived from the Rohirric _Holbytlan_(hole builders).\nThese names are also translations of the original Westron _Kuduk_\n(Hobbit) and Rohirric _kûd-dûkan_ (hole dweller), of course.\n\n\nPolitics\n\nAlliance with Gondor\n\nThe alliance between Rohan and Gondor came into existence in TA 2510. In\nthat year the Easterlings launched a massive invasion of Gondor. The\narmy of Gondor was defeated and trapped between the Limlight and the\nCelebrant. Gondor, which had always been on friendly terms with the\ndifferent tribes of the Northmen, sent messengers to the closest tribe,\nthe Éothéod. Although it was unlikely that the message calling for aid\nwould come through, it did. Then Eorl the Young and his fierce Éothéod\nRiders unexpectedly took the field during the Battle of Celebrant and\nturned the tide in the favour of Gondor. As a reward Cirion, the Steward\nof Gondor, gave Eorl the depopulated province of Calenardhon for his\npeople to settle, while fulfilling Gondor's need for a strong ally. The\nOath of Eorl was sworn by both Cirion and Eorl. Neither nation has\nbroken the alliance ever since. Rohan has gone through great lengths to\nfulfill its part of the treaty including sacrificing two of its heirs\nwhen Gondor was under threat from the Haradrim in TA 2885, when Fastred\nand Folcred, the twin sons of King Folcwine, were killed during the\nBattle of Crossings of Poros. King Théoden once again honoured the\nalliance in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nWar with the Dunlendings\n\nTo the west of Rohan lived the Dunlendings, a native people who had been\nhostile to the Free Peoples for a long time. The Dunlending Wulf briefly\nwas a usurper of the throne of Rohan during the long winter.\n\nRumours of tributes paid to Sauron\n\nDuring the early days of the War of the Ring, rumours were spread that\nthe Rohirrim supplied Sauron's armies with horses. These rumours were\nobviously false: the Rohirrim valued their horses more than anything,\nand would never send them away, even as tribute. Still, these rumours\nhad some effect, in that they obscured the fact it was Saruman who had\nfallen, rather than Rohan. The basis of the rumour was that Sauron's\norcs on raids into Rohan stole their horses for use in Mordor's army,\nbut this was outright theft that angered the Rohirrim against Sauron.\n\nWormtongue's influence\n\nWhen King Théoden began to grow old, he took as an adviser Gríma, later\ncalled _Wormtongue_. Gríma quickly became Théoden’s chief adviser, but\nunknown to all he was secretly working for Saruman. Gríma played on\nThéoden fears to further weaken the strength of the king and all of\nRohan, always advising retreat where an attack was needed. He may have\nalso begun poisoning the king at this time. This nearly proved\ndisastrous for Rohan, and also for Gondor, by robbing them of their\nstrongest ally in the north. Gríma Wormtongue’s plans were not revealed\nuntil Gandalf arrived at Edoras during the War of the Ring.\n\nRohan's Military\n\n\n\nThe Rohirrim are descendants of the Edain of the First Age. They didn't\ngo to Beleriand like the Edain who were later rewarded with the island\nof Númenor by the Valar. The ancestors of the Rohirrim were known as the\nÉothéod and were given the province of Calenardhon by Gondor after the\naforementioned Battle of the Field of Celebrant.\n\nThe Rohirrim are famous as skilled horsemen, masters, and Horse breeding\namong the horses of the Rohirrim are the famed Mearas, the noblest and\nfastest horses who have ever roamed Arda; Shadowfax was the greatest of\nall Mearas. There were very few Mearas left in Middle-earth at this\npoint, but there were enough that a breeding population was present. The\narmies of Rohan are almost exclusively cavalry, divided into irregular\nunits termed éoreds. Rohan's foot-men armies were more of a very well\ntrained militia called upon in times of war, the militia of Rohan\nwielded wooden shields of all sizes and used four weapons: longswords,\nshort bows, axes, and longspears. The actual standing infantry army was\nrelatively small with the professional career limited to the royal\nbodyguard of Edoras. Royal Guard of Rohan of Edoras were the elite\nsoldiers of Rohan and fought on foot as well as on their horses, they\nhave heavy plate-armour and wield large round wooden shields, their\nweapons were mostly the longspears which were used for thrusting or\nthrowing at their enemies, they also carried longswords for close combat\nin the event that they lost their spear. Their powerful cavalry (the\nRohirrim) could cut through almost any infantry lines and cavalry units\nand turn the tide of battle. The warriors of Rohan used the same weapons\nas their footmen counterparts when on horseback.\n\nIt was because of this close affiliation with horses, both in war and in\npeace, that they received their now famous name. _Rohirrim_ (or more\nproperly _Rochirrim_) is Sindarin for “Horse-lords,” and _Rohan_ (or\n_Rochand_) meant \"Land of the Horse-lords.",
